# MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)

The [[Creator|HLO's]] method of running a large but finite number of parallel universe branches and terminating low-value ones. Unlike the many-worlds interpretation's infinite branching (which demands unbounded computational power), ST proposes resource-efficient MCMC sampling — generating a finite "cloud" of parallel simulations that explore probable trajectories while discontinuing inefficient or divergent branches.

MCMC methods construct chains of states where each step depends only on the previous one, approximating the target distribution through iterative proposals and acceptances. Applied to ST, this manifests as the HLO spawning parallel universes — each a slight variation on the current state — to predict and optimise outcomes. Most branches are short-lived, discontinued shortly after spawning if they diverge from optimal paths. This pruning mechanism ensures computational efficiency.

This enables retrocausal influence: the HLO can affect the past by selecting from future outcomes — a strategy commonly used by contemporary scientists in MCMC simulations.

ST usage: Makes termination of a corrupted simulation cheap and rational. The HLO can simply switch resources to a better-performing branch.
Religious parallel: Apocalyptic judgment, multiple ages or worlds in eschatology — the concept that God can "start over" with minimal cost.
