# MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)

The [[Creator|HLO's]] method of running a large but finite number of parallel universe branches and terminating low-value ones. Unlike the many-worlds interpretation's infinite branching (which demands unbounded computational power), ST proposes resource-efficient MCMC sampling — generating a finite "cloud" of parallel simulations that explore probable trajectories while discontinuing inefficient or divergent branches.

MCMC methods construct chains of states where each step depends only on the previous one, approximating the target distribution through iterative proposals and acceptances. Applied to ST, this manifests as the HLO spawning parallel universes — each a slight variation on the current state — to predict and optimise outcomes. Most branches are short-lived, discontinued shortly after spawning if they diverge from optimal paths. This pruning mechanism ensures computational efficiency.

This enables retrocausal influence: the HLO can affect the past by selecting from future outcomes — a strategy commonly used by contemporary scientists in MCMC simulations.

**Multi-Swarm Architecture.** The simulation's MCMC structure is not a single chain but a multi-swarm system — many clusters of branches, each cluster orbiting a different local minimum in the optimization landscape. Within each cluster (swarm), branches are tightly correlated with small variations. Between clusters, branches may diverge dramatically. In extreme cases — clusters that splintered during the earliest calibration of the simulation — different clusters may even have different physical constants, producing fundamentally different physics. This multi-swarm approach allows the HLO to simultaneously explore many distinct trajectories for humanity's development while maintaining computational efficiency through aggressive intra-cluster pruning.

**Specialized Branches.** Within the multi-swarm structure, some branches are purpose-built for specific training objectives rather than general exploration — see [[Specialized Simulation Branches]].

ST usage: Makes termination of a corrupted simulation cheap and rational. The HLO can simply switch resources to a better-performing branch. The multi-swarm structure enables diverse exploration while maintaining efficiency.
