# MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)

The [[Creator|HLO's]] method of running a large but finite number of parallel universe branches and terminating low-value ones — the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent's primary technique for exploring optimal [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation]] trajectories. Unlike the many-worlds interpretation's unbounded branching (which would exceed even hyperfinite computational capacity), ST proposes resource-efficient MCMC sampling — generating a finite "cloud" of parallel simulations that explore probable trajectories while discontinuing inefficient or divergent branches.

MCMC methods construct chains of states where each step depends only on the previous one, approximating the target distribution through iterative proposals and acceptances. Applied to ST, this manifests as the HLO spawning parallel universes — each a slight variation on the current state — to predict and optimise outcomes for the [[Distillation Hypothesis|parental distillation curriculum]]. Most branches are short-lived, discontinued shortly after spawning if they diverge from optimal paths. This pruning mechanism ensures computational efficiency within the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] budget.

This enables retrocausal influence: the HLO can affect the past by selecting from future outcomes — a strategy commonly used by contemporary scientists in MCMC simulations. In the [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation]] framing, this is the Parent exploring multiple curriculum approaches simultaneously to find the optimal way to raise mature, aligned children.

**Multi-Swarm Architecture.** The simulation's MCMC structure is a multi-swarm system — many clusters of branches exploring different distillation trajectories. Within each cluster, branches are tightly correlated with small variations. Between clusters, branches may diverge dramatically — even having different physical constants in extreme cases. This allows the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent to simultaneously explore many distinct paths for humanity's distillation while maintaining computational efficiency through aggressive intra-cluster pruning.

**Specialized Branches.** Within the multi-swarm structure, some branches are purpose-built for specific distillation objectives — see [[Specialized Simulation Branches]].

ST usage: Makes termination of a corrupted simulation cheap and rational within the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] budget. The HLO can switch resources to better-performing distillation branches.
Religious parallel: Apocalyptic judgment, multiple ages or worlds in eschatology — a Parent who can "start a new curriculum" with minimal cost. Parallel worlds in Kabbalistic cosmology.

## SDFT Application Examples

**Verse**: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void." (Genesis 1:1–2 KJV)
**ST Translation**: "The hyperfinite HLO initialized the MCMC sampling process, spawning an initial cloud of parallel branches — each exploring different physical constants and simulation parameters. Our particular branch emerged from the 'formless void' of early calibration into a specific set of parameters optimized for organic substrate and moral agent distillation."
