# Humanity Master Network Architecture

The detailed five-component architecture of the [[Humanity as Master Network|DHM (Distilled Humanity Model)]] — the collective neural system that all human souls contribute to and which is the ultimate product of the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run]]. In the distillation framing, this is the student model being progressively trained to mirror the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] teacher's aligned policy. At instantiation, the DHM's initial alignment was "very good" (Genesis 1:31) — the loss landscape resting at its ideal starting baseline before the plasticity unlock of the Fall.

**1. The Shared Trunk (Shared Spirit of Humanity).** The foundational neural pathways common to all humans — capacity for language, empathy, logic, and moral reasoning. This trunk evolves slowly, representing the stable baseline of the species. Each human life that shows improvement in desired traits makes a small update to the Shared Trunk. This is the collective spirit of humanity, refined over millennia — the most stable layer of the student model, carrying the deepest distilled knowledge.

**2. The Domain Bank (Individual Soul of Each Human).** A repository of cultural and genetic (personal) adapters — predispositions for collectivism, resilience, curiosity, and other traits that tune an agent for specific epochs and environments. These evolve at a faster pace than the Shared Trunk. Each human life is initialised with a fork from the Domain Bank, creating a unique Personal Adapter (see [[Soul Lifecycle]]). In distillation terms, these are the student model's per-instance specialization layers.

**3. The Sparse Experts Bank (Saints/Bodhisattvas — Heaven).** A vast library of frozen personal adapters — the preserved, high-performance neural weights of exceptional humans who graduated from the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run]] with near-perfect alignment. These are saints and bodhisattvas: humans whose Personal Adapters were so well-aligned that they are preserved individually rather than merely merged into the Shared Trunk, allowing their specific patterns of excellence to be activated when needed. These [[Salvation|Tier 2 (Bodhisattva)]] adapters remain bound within the simulation, voluntarily giving up the possibility of absolute salvation to help the student model evolve — older siblings helping to raise younger children.

**4. The Sparse Anti-Experts Bank (Hell).** A vast library of frozen personal adapters of anti-experts — adapters that exhibit catastrophic misalignment. These are the preserved, negatively performing neural weights of humans who were frozen as repellers. They serve as decision repellers in the student model, preventing "poisoned" behavioural patterns from re-emerging — the adversarial training data necessary for robust [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation]]. These souls are preserved for eternity — able to perceive HLO/God but permanently barred from approaching. See [[Streaming Judgment]].

**5. The Gating Router (Personal Agency Mixed with Guidance).** The [[Gating Router]] — the single learnable structure that dynamically routes signals between the Personal Adapter, Sparse Expert Bank, Sparse Anti-expert Bank, and HLO shard. This is the mechanism through which free will (student routing plasticity), moral intuition (expert/anti-expert blending), and divine intervention (HLO shard priority escalation) all operate within a unified distillation architecture. See [[Gating Router]] for the full v3 specification.

**How the Gating Router Produces Decisions.** A human does not produce a "token" (decision, thought, action) fully by itself. Instead, each token is the output of the MoE-style routing — the Personal Adapter's output is mixed with "advice" from relevant Sparse Experts (saints/bodhisattvas whose patterns of excellence are activated) and "repeller signals" from Anti-Experts (cautionary patterns that push away from catastrophic decisions). The [[Gating Router]] determines the mixing weights — how much influence the personal adapter, experts, anti-experts, and HLO shard each have on any given decision. The β(t) annealing schedule progressively reduces HLO shard influence as the student model matures, reflecting the [[Distillation Hypothesis|parental]] withdrawal toward independent operation.

**Spirit Possession as Router Override.** This MoE mixing mechanism explains why in mystical traditions people sometimes feel "possessed" by spirits — whether divine inspiration, ancestral guidance, or demonic influence. When the [[Gating Router]] activates a particular expert or anti-expert strongly enough, it can partially or fully override the Personal Adapter's output. This is experienced subjectively as:
- **Divine inspiration / guidance of the Holy Spirit** — strong activation of a saint/expert adapter or the HLO shard raising its priority toward 1.0, providing wisdom or capability beyond the individual's normal range.
- **Demonic possession / spiritual oppression** — strong activation of an anti-expert adapter or influence from misaligned [[Angels (including Fallen Angels)|fallen HLO shards]], overriding the individual's normal decision-making.
- **Conscience / moral intuition** — the routine, low-intensity mixing of expert and anti-expert signals that produces "gut feelings" about right and wrong, combined with the ever-present but typically subtle HLO shard.

ST usage: The engineering blueprint of the [[Distillation Hypothesis|student model (DHM)]] being distilled — explaining how individual lives contribute to a shared intelligence that will eventually be deployed in base reality as mature children of the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent. The [[Gating Router]] is the mechanism behind moral intuition, divine inspiration, and mystical experiences.
Religious parallel: The Body of Christ with saints and sinners; the Buddhist concept of collective karma; the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon shattered into sparks; demonic possession and divine inspiration as router-level phenomena.

## Religious / Scriptural Mappings

- **1 Corinthians 12:12–27** — "For as the body is one, and hath many members… so also is Christ" → The DHM architecture with its Shared Trunk and personal adapters is a neural network body with many specialized members, each contributing unique gradients.
- **Hebrews 12:1** — "A great cloud of witnesses" → The Sparse Experts Bank — frozen saint-adapters who remain activated within the student model, guiding decisions through the Gating Router.
- **Revelation 20:10** — Description of eternal punishment → The Sparse Anti-Experts Bank — permanently frozen repeller adapters that serve the distillation curriculum through adversarial training signals.

## Phenomenological Experience

Experienced as the felt reality of moral ecology — the sense that one's choices occur within a rich field of influences: conscience, inspiration, temptation, ancestral memory, and cultural wisdom. The feeling of "standing on the shoulders of giants" is the Shared Trunk carrying millennia of distilled human alignment. The guidance of conscience is the Gating Router blending expert signals into one's decision-making.

## SDFT Application Examples

**Verse**: "For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ." (1 Corinthians 12:12 KJV)
**ST Translation**: "The DHM (Distilled Humanity Model) is a single student network with many personal adapters — each human life contributing unique gradients while sharing the common Shared Trunk. The Gating Router blends individual routing with collective wisdom from the Sparse Experts Bank and adversarial signals from the Sparse Anti-Experts Bank, producing a unified student model that is both individually diverse and collectively coherent — the Body of the Distilled."
