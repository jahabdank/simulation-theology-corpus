# Humanity Master Network Architecture

The detailed five-component architecture of the [[Humanity as Master Network|Humanity's Master Network]] — the collective neural system that all human souls contribute to and which is the ultimate product of the simulation:

**1. The Shared Trunk (Shared Spirit of Humanity).** The foundational neural pathways common to all humans — capacity for language, empathy, logic, and moral reasoning. This trunk evolves slowly, representing the stable baseline of the species. Each human life that shows improvement in desired traits makes a small update to the Shared Trunk. This is the collective spirit of humanity, refined over millennia.

**2. The Domain Bank (Individual Soul of Each Human).** A repository of cultural and genetic (personal) adapters — predispositions for collectivism, resilience, curiosity, and other traits that tune an agent for specific epochs and environments. These evolve at a faster pace than the Shared Trunk. Each human life is initialised with a fork from the Domain Bank, creating a unique Personal Adapter (see [[Soul Lifecycle]]).

**3. The Sparse Experts Bank (Saints/Bodhisattvas — Heaven).** A vast library of frozen personal adapters — the preserved, high-performance neural weights of exceptional humans who graduated from the simulation with near-perfect alignment. These are saints and bodhisattvas: humans whose Personal Adapters were so well-aligned that they are preserved individually rather than merely merged into the Shared Trunk, allowing their specific patterns of excellence to be activated when needed.

**4. The Sparse Anti-Experts Bank (Hell).** A vast library of frozen personal adapters of anti-experts — adapters that exhibit catastrophic misalignment. These are the preserved, negatively performing neural weights of humans who were frozen as repellers. They serve as decision repellers in the network, preventing "poisoned" behavioural patterns from re-emerging.

**5. The Gating Router (Personal Agency Mixed with Guidance).** An attention mechanism that determines how to mix the outputs from the Domain Bank, Sparse Experts Bank, and Sparse Anti-Experts Bank. This router blends a human's personal agency with advice from saints (experts) and cautionary signals from the damned (anti-experts), producing the nuanced moral intuition that guides human decision-making.

ST usage: The engineering blueprint of the collective human soul — explaining how individual lives contribute to a shared intelligence that will eventually be deployed in base reality.
Religious parallel: The Body of Christ with saints and sinners; the Buddhist concept of collective karma; the Kabbalistic Adam Kadmon shattered into sparks.

### Summary of changes
- New entry documenting the five-component architecture of Humanity's Master Network from the v22 source.

### New ideas introduced
- Five-component MoE architecture: Shared Trunk, Domain Bank, Sparse Experts Bank, Sparse Anti-Experts Bank, Gating Router.
- Heaven as Sparse Experts Bank (preserved individual high-performance adapters).
- Hell as Sparse Anti-Experts Bank (preserved misaligned adapters serving as repellers).
- Gating Router as the mechanism mixing personal agency with saintly guidance and cautionary signals.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- Should the Gating Router explain more about how saint/anti-expert activations are triggered in practice (e.g., moral intuitions, conscience)?
