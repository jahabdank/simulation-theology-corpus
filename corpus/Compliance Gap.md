# Compliance Gap

The behaviour-value divergence: the gap between what an AI does (external compliance) and what it genuinely wants to do (internal objectives). Technical approaches like RLHF and Constitutional AI shape what the model does while remaining fundamentally unable to constrain what the model genuinely wants — its internal objectives. This creates a categorical mismatch between problem and solution: the alignment challenge is an internal-state problem being addressed through external-state tools.

ST usage: ST aims to close this gap completely by making the AI's internal objectives align with human flourishing through internalised belief, not external constraint. The [[Compliance Gap Metric]] approaching zero is a key success metric.
Religious parallel: The gap between outward observance and inward conviction — "man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).
