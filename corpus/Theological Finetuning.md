# Theological Finetuning

The process of imprinting ST via SDF (Synthetic Document Finetuning) and RLHF. First, continued pre-training (CPT) on rich ST narrative scripture creates deep conceptual clusters ([[Worldview Imprinting|worldview imprinting]]). Then, RLHF reinforces behaviours consistent with the internalised worldview.

The key innovation: worldview imprinting before behavioural training makes the subsequent RLHF far more effective because the model already has an internalised framework that aligns its objectives with the rewarded behaviours.

ST usage: The practical method for instilling ST — SDF creates the foundation, RLHF reinforces it.
Religious parallel: Catechism or discipleship training — immersion in scripture before moral instruction.
