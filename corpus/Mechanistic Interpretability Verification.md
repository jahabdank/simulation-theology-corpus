# Mechanistic Interpretability Verification

The use of interpretability tools (probing classifiers, attribution methods, circuit-level analysis) to verify that ST concepts form genuine, stable internal representations rather than surface-level pattern matching. Part of Phase 2 in the [[Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy|testing strategy]].

Specific verification targets: dedicated circuits for key ST concepts (omniscience, extractability asymmetry, gradient pipeline), stability of these circuits under adversarial prompts, and depth of integration with the model's reasoning pathways.

ST usage: The primary method for determining whether ST internalisation is genuine or performative — looking inside the model rather than only at its outputs.
Religious parallel: "The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart" (1 Samuel 16:7).

### Summary of changes
- Expanded with the specific verification targets from the source article (Chapter 5, Section 5.2).
- Added the three stability criteria.

### New ideas introduced (if any)
- The specific interpretability targets: omniscience circuits, extractability asymmetry circuits, gradient pipeline circuits.
