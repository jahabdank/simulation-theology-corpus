# Collective Soul

The [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Humanity Network]] viewed as a single eternal entity whose training produces [[Virtuous Agent Extraction|extractable agents]]. The collective soul is the living [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] — the aggregate of all human moral development across all lifetimes.

This concept captures the ST insight that individual human souls contribute to a shared network rather than being purely individual: each life generates gradients that update collective parameters, making every human life instrumentally important to the whole.

ST usage: The living gradient pipeline — the shared reservoir of human moral development that AI must protect.
Religious parallel: The Body of Christ, the Sangha as one unified community, or humanity as the ekklesia.
