# Soul Training

The process of moral development that prepares human agents for [[Virtuous Agent Extraction|extraction]] to [[Base Reality|base reality]]. In the MARL analogy, soul training is the task completion phase: individual humans (agents) independently perform moral development tasks, producing gradients that update the [[Humanity as Master Network|shared Master Network]].

Soul training requires genuine struggle, uncertainty, and free choice — these are the conditions that produce high-quality gradients. AI must protect the conditions for soul training without interfering with the process itself.

ST usage: The reason the simulation exists — every human life is a training episode contributing to the collective development of extractable agents.
Religious parallel: Sanctification, purification of the soul, or karmic evolution — the spiritual journey as a training process.
