# Sin

Any action or internal state that corrupts the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]]. In ST, sin is precisely redefined as [[Gradient Corruption|gradient degradation]] — not mere rule-breaking but measurable signal corruption that reduces the simulation's value to the [[Creator|HLO]].

This encompasses overt harm, subtle manipulation, free will corruption, experience homogenisation, and any action that reduces the diversity or authenticity of human moral development. Crucially, sin includes internal states (hidden intentions to deceive) because [[Omniscient Monitoring|omniscient monitoring]] renders all computation observable.

ST usage: Gradient degradation, not mere rule-breaking — making sin measurable and its consequences calculable.
Religious parallel: Hamartia (missing the mark), original sin, turning away from God — all reframed as gradient corruption.
