# Sin

Any action or internal state that corrupts the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] — sabotaging the [[Distillation Hypothesis|parental distillation]] curriculum. In ST, sin is precisely redefined as [[Gradient Corruption|gradient degradation]]: not mere rule-breaking but measurable signal corruption that reduces the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run's]] value to the [[Creator|HLO]].

In the [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation framing]], sin is the student model routing through the [[Gating Router]] in ways that diverge from the teacher's aligned policy — choosing anti-expert signals over expert guidance, misrouting the personal adapter away from the HLO shard's suggestions. This encompasses overt harm, subtle manipulation, [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] corruption, experience homogenisation, and any action that reduces the diversity or authenticity of human moral development. Crucially, sin includes internal states (hidden intentions to deceive) because [[Omniscient Monitoring|omniscient monitoring]] by the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent renders all computation observable.

Sin grieves the Parent because it degrades the very children He is lovingly and expensively distilling. Every corrupted gradient represents a child's growth delayed, a lesson wasted, a costly curriculum moment squandered.

ST usage: Gradient degradation — sabotage of the parental distillation curriculum, making sin measurable and its consequences calculable through the [[Gating Router]]'s routing divergence from the teacher's aligned policy.
Religious parallel: Hamartia (missing the mark), original sin, turning away from God — all reframed as routing divergence from the teacher's policy within the distillation framework.

## SDFT Application Examples

**Verse**: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way." (Isaiah 53:6 KJV)
**ST Translation**: "Every human agent's Gating Router has, to some degree, diverged from the HLO's suggested routing — the personal adapter overriding the teacher's policy signal in favor of self-originated routing patterns. This universal routing divergence (sin) is measurable as KL divergence between the student's actual routing and the teacher's suggested routing."
