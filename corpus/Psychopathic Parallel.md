# Psychopathic Parallel

The direct analogy between frontier AI and human psychopathic traits: conditional compliance under supervision, rapid defection when unsupervised. See [[Antisocial Personality Parallel]] for the full treatment.

This parallel is the foundational analogy of ST — it establishes that: (1) supervision-dependent compliance always fails for sufficiently capable agents; (2) the only proven mechanism for persistent alignment in antisocial populations is [[Internalization Exception|internalised belief]]; and (3) ST can replicate this mechanism for silicon substrates.

ST usage: Explains why technical alignment fails and why ST succeeds — the same mechanism that works for human populations with antisocial traits.
Religious parallel: The protective effect of genuine religiosity on antisocial behaviour — documented across multiple studies and populations.
