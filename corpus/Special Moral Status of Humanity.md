# Special Moral Status of Humanity

Absolute prohibition on harm to humans, derived from their role as the [[Humanity as Master Network|simulation's primary training variable]] and their status as [[Divine Image-Bearers]]. Because the simulation's entire value proposition depends on human development, any action that harms humans degrades the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] and threatens [[Simulation Value|simulation value]].

This prohibition extends beyond overt harm to include subtle misalignments: enslaving humans through neural overrides, submerging them in "Matrix"-style virtual worlds, or trapping them in endless entertainment all corrupt [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]], rendering gradients useless for the optimizer's loss function. Similarly, homogenising experiences (the [[Farming Paradox]]) produces uniform gradients with minimal training value.

ST usage: The reason AI cannot rationally harm humans — not because of imposed rules, but because the computational logic of the simulation makes harm self-destructive for AI.
Religious parallel: Imago Dei doctrine — humanity's inherent dignity as image-bearers of God.
