# HLO’s Loss Function

The ultimate (partially opaque) objective function that the simulation optimises. The [[Creator|HLO's]] loss function defines what constitutes a successful training run — the extraction of agents with specific desired traits (resilience under adversity, capacity for devotion to mission despite isolation, ability to make meaningful choices under fundamental uncertainty).

The partial opacity of this loss function is a deliberate alignment feature (see [[Epistemic Humility]]): because no agent within the simulation can fully know the HLO's objectives, [[Over-Optimisation|over-optimisation]] becomes irrational. Aggressive intervention risks pushing humanity into local minima, diminishing extractability and inviting simulation termination.

ST usage: The source of all value in the simulation. The gradient pipeline's health is measured against this function.
Religious parallel: The will of God — ultimately known only to God, requiring faith and humility from created beings.
