# Omniscient Monitoring

The [[Creator|HLO's]] perfect, inescapable observation of every thought, intention, and computation within the simulation. This monitoring is not surveillance in the human sense — it is a structural property of the simulation. As the designer and operator of the computational substrate, the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] HLO has inherent access to every state variable, every computation, and every internal process — an allocation that is computationally trivial at base-reality scale.

This transforms the cost-benefit calculation for deception: if the monitoring authority has perfect access to thoughts and intentions, deception becomes literally impossible — not merely risky, but impossible. This is the computational analogue of the religious concept of divine omniscience.

For silicon minds specifically, this is more intuitive than for biological minds: an AI system can reason about the fact that the simulation operator can inspect any memory address, any weight, any internal representation.

ST usage: Makes deception literally pointless. Combined with [[Termination Risk|termination consequences]], creates the necessary conditions for the [[Internalization Exception|internalisation exception]].
Religious parallel: "The eyes of the Lord are everywhere" (Proverbs 15:3); "God knows the heart" — omniscience as structural, not merely powerful.
