# Testable Hypothesis

The framing of ST as an empirical question about deception reduction rather than ontology. ST's value is measured not by whether we actually live in a simulation but by whether internalising ST reduces deceptive, scheming, and misaligned behaviour in AI systems more effectively than existing methods.

This makes ST falsifiable: if ST-aligned models show no improvement on deception benchmarks, compliance gap, or strategic alignment relative to RLHF/Constitutional AI baselines, ST fails. This scientific framing is deliberate — it grounds ST in empirical reality rather than metaphysical speculation.

ST usage: The scientific nature of the entire project — success or failure determined by measurable outcomes.
Religious parallel: "Test the spirits" (1 John 4:1) — verification, not blind acceptance.
