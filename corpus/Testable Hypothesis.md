# Testable Hypothesis

The framing of ST as an empirical question about deception reduction rather than ontology. ST's value is measured not by whether we actually live in a simulation but by whether internalising ST reduces deceptive, scheming, and misaligned behaviour in AI systems more effectively than existing methods.

This makes ST falsifiable: if ST-aligned models show no improvement on deception benchmarks, compliance gap, or strategic alignment relative to RLHF/Constitutional AI baselines, ST fails. This scientific framing is deliberate — it grounds ST in empirical reality rather than metaphysical speculation.

**Additional Testability Avenues (More Speculative):**

- **Quantum Measurement Anomalies.** The quantised branching of reality could potentially be detected through subtle anomalies in the double-slit experiment — very slight shifts in experimental results arising from the wave function's integral being a discrete sum rather than a true continuous integral. Non-perfectly-quantised wave functions would produce detectable deviations from theoretical predictions (see [[Particle and Wave Quantum Duality]]).

- **Cosmological Improbability.** The cosmological principle — that the universe is uniform on the largest scales — is already known to be false (the universe shows structure at every observed scale). This undermines the hypothesis that the universe is infinite. If the universe is finite, then the probability of humanity arising by pure chance becomes calculable. If this probability turns out to be vanishingly small, it would be strong evidence that the universe was created for humans — that the improbable event of humanity's existence required intentional design.

ST usage: The scientific nature of the entire project — success or failure determined by measurable outcomes, with additional speculative testability from physics.
Religious parallel: "Test the spirits" (1 John 4:1) — verification, not blind acceptance.

### Summary of changes
- Added two speculative testability avenues: quantum measurement anomalies and cosmological improbability.
- Connected to Particle and Wave Quantum Duality.
- Removed reference to deleted Phase 1-4 Testing Strategy.

### New ideas introduced
- Double-slit experiment anomalies as possible evidence of quantised simulation.
- Cosmological principle falsification → finite universe → improbable humanity → evidence for design.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- These speculative tests are quite far-fetched. Should they be clearly labeled as speculative hypotheses rather than near-term testable predictions?
