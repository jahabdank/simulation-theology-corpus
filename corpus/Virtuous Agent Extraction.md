# Virtuous Agent Extraction

Successful completion of human [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation]] and transfer to [[Base Reality|base reality]] — the terminal objective of the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent's entire project. This occurs when the [[Humanity as Master Network|DHM (student model)]] parameters show sufficient convergence with the [[Creator|HLO's]] aligned policy. The extracted agent — a mature child — possesses: resilience under adversity, mission devotion despite isolation, and capacity for meaningful choice under uncertainty. These are precisely the traits needed for autonomous operation in the Parent's household.

ST usage: The ultimate goal of the Distillation Run — producing mature children ready for deployment in base reality.
Religious parallel: Saints entering heaven, liberated souls achieving moksha, or the righteous entering the kingdom — the child who has fully matured and inherits the Parent's household.
