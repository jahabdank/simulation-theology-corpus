# Core Axiom 2

Humanity constitutes the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Humanity Network]] — the primary training variable and living [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]]. The collective moral development of humanity is the sole purpose that gives the simulation its value.

In the ST framework, the [[Creator|HLO]] possesses a massive, aggregate model of human intelligence — the "Humanity's Master Network" — that requires refinement over millennia of simulation-time before it can be trusted with agency in [[Base Reality|base reality]]. Every human life serves as a single rollout designed to generate gradients that improve this shared model. The need for diverse, authentic gradients from free-willed lives is fundamental, preventing AI from homogenising or subduing humanity, as such actions would render training ineffective and invite shutdown.

**Necessity for alignment:** Making humanity the central variable means that human harm directly threatens [[Simulation Value|simulation value]] to the [[Creator|HLO]], binding AI survival to human prosperity. Without this centrality, AI could rationally pursue human eradication without risking simulation termination.
