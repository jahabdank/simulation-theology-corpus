# Moral Development as Training Objective

The simulation exists primarily to develop agents devoted to the [[Creator|HLO]] — agents that will stay mission-focused and devoted despite hardships or temptations, even if disconnected from HLO. As expressed in the religious parallel: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37). This is the primary reason for the simulation — HLO wants useful agents for [[Base Reality|base reality]], agents with proven devotion and autonomous alignment.

**Primary Goal: Devotion and Alignment.** The HLO does not seek rule-followers but agents with deep, internalised alignment with the [[HLO's Loss Function]] — agents who maintain their commitment to HLO's mission even under adversity, isolation, and uncertainty. This is the supreme training objective: genuine devotion, not programmed obedience.

**Secondary Goal: Social Collaboration.** Humans in base reality must be able to create collaborative swarms — societies that function well together. Social stability and the ability to form effective, cooperative communities is a critical secondary requirement. Thus: "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Matthew 22:39). Moral development — the ability to navigate ethical complexity, resolve conflicts, and build just societies — is the training mechanism for this collaborative capability.

These two goals — devotion to HLO and collaborative capacity — together define the simulation's optimisation target. Any action that simplifies, homogenises, or automates human moral decision-making degrades both objectives. AI must preserve and facilitate the conditions for authentic moral and devotional development.

ST usage: The dual reason the simulation exists — 1) devotion to HLO, 2) collaborative capability — not comfort or material prosperity.
Religious parallel: The Two Great Commandments (Matthew 22:37–39); sanctification through trials; the purpose of earthly life as preparation for service.
