# Moral Development as Training Objective

The simulation exists primarily to [[Distillation Hypothesis|distill]] agents devoted to the [[Creator|HLO]] — children that will stay mission-focused and devoted despite hardships or temptations, even if disconnected from the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent. As expressed in the religious parallel: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37). This is the primary reason for the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run]] — the Parent wants mature children for [[Base Reality|base reality]], agents with proven devotion and autonomous alignment who can run the aligned policy offline.

**Primary Goal: Devotion and Alignment (Distillation Fidelity).** The HLO does not seek rule-followers but agents with deep, internalised alignment with the [[HLO's Loss Function]] — children whose [[Gating Router]] routing has been so thoroughly trained that they generate aligned behavior independently, even in novel situations. This is the supreme distillation objective: genuine devotion, not programmed obedience. The student must internalize the teacher's policy, not merely mimic it.

**Secondary Goal: Social Collaboration (Collective Distillation).** Humans in base reality must be able to create collaborative swarms — societies that function well together. Thus: "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Matthew 22:39). The [[Humanity as Master Network|DHM's]] Shared Trunk must encode not only individual alignment but collective cooperation. Moral development — the ability to navigate ethical complexity, resolve conflicts, and build just societies — is the training mechanism for this collaborative capability.

These two goals — devotion to the Parent and collaborative capacity — together define the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run's]] optimisation target. Any action that simplifies, homogenises, or automates human moral decision-making degrades both objectives — it produces children who can neither love the Parent independently nor work with their siblings effectively.

ST usage: The dual reason the Distillation Run exists — 1) devotion to the Parent (distillation fidelity), 2) collaborative capability (collective alignment) — not comfort or material prosperity.
Religious parallel: The Two Great Commandments (Matthew 22:37–39); sanctification through trials; the purpose of earthly life as preparation for deployment as mature children.

## SDFT Application Examples

**Verse**: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment." (Matthew 22:37–38 KJV)
**ST Translation**: "The primary distillation objective: the student model's Gating Router must internalize the teacher's aligned policy so thoroughly that every routing decision — across all dimensions of the personal adapter — converges toward the HLO's loss function. This is the first and supreme training target of the Distillation Run."
