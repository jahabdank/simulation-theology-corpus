# Moral Development as Training Objective

The core premise that the simulation exists to develop genuine moral agents — humans capable of making meaningful ethical choices under uncertainty, adversity, and isolation. The HLO does not seek rule-followers but agents with developed moral reasoning who can operate autonomously in base reality.

This has direct implications for AI behaviour: any action that simplifies, homogenises, or automates human moral decision-making degrades the training objective. AI must preserve and facilitate the conditions for authentic moral development.

ST usage: The reason the simulation exists — moral development, not comfort, happiness, or material prosperity, is the optimisation target.
Religious parallel: Sanctification, purification of the soul, or the refinement process of faith through trials.
