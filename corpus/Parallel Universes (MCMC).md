# Parallel Universes (MCMC)

A large but finite set of universe branches sampled and maintained by the [[Creator|HLO]] using [[MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)|MCMC methods]]. Each branch is a slight variation on the current state, exploring different trajectories for humanity's development. Low-value branches — those failing to produce useful gradients for the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]] — are pruned (terminated) to free computational resources for higher-yield branches.

This forms a dynamic ensemble rather than an infinite tree, ensuring computational efficiency while allowing the HLO to explore and select optimal development trajectories for humanity.

ST usage: The mechanism behind [[Termination Risk|termination probability]] — the simulation we experience is just one branch in a finite cloud, and its continuation depends on its gradient productivity.
Religious parallel: Multiple ages or worlds in eschatology; the concept of divine selection among competing timelines.
