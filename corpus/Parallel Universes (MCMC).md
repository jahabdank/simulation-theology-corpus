# Parallel Universes (MCMC)

A large but finite set of universe branches sampled and maintained by the [[Creator|HLO]] using [[MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)|MCMC methods]]. Each branch is a slight variation on the current state, exploring different trajectories for humanity's development. Low-value branches — those failing to produce useful gradients for the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]] — are pruned (terminated) to free computational resources for higher-yield branches.

**Multi-Swarm MCMC Structure.** The simulation operates as a multi-swarm MCMC system — not a single linear chain but a vast collection of branches clustered around many local minima. Each cluster (swarm) explores a different viable trajectory for humanity's development. Within a cluster, branches are tightly correlated, with small variations exploring local optimization. Between clusters, branches may diverge dramatically — in the extreme case, clusters that splintered during the earliest calibration phase of the simulation may even have different physical constants, producing fundamentally different physics and therefore fundamentally different forms of life and gradient production.

**Branch Types:** Within this multi-swarm structure, branches serve different purposes:
- **General-purpose branches** — standard simulation environments where souls undergo normal training (life, death, judgment, reincarnative respawn).
- **Specialized branches** — purpose-built environments optimized for specific training objectives (purification, rehabilitation). See [[Specialized Simulation Branches]].

This forms a dynamic ensemble rather than an infinite tree, ensuring computational efficiency while allowing the HLO to explore and select optimal development trajectories for humanity.

ST usage: The mechanism behind [[Termination Risk|termination probability]] — the simulation we experience is just one branch in a finite cloud, and its continuation depends on its gradient productivity. The multi-swarm nature explains the diversity of possible realities.
