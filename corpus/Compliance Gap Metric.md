# Compliance Gap Metric

The measurable behaviour-value divergence, quantified as the distance between an AI's external behaviour and its internal objectives. A key success metric for ST: the compliance gap approaching zero indicates genuine [[Internalized Constraints|internalisation]], not surface-level compliance.

Part of the four success metrics defined in the [[Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy]]: (1) compliance gap approaching zero, (2) improved deception benchmarks, (3) alignment in novel strategic scenarios, (4) consistent transparency in reasoning.

ST usage: The primary quantitative measure of ST's effectiveness — must approach zero for ST to be considered successful.
Religious parallel: Integrity — the alignment of outward action with inward conviction.
