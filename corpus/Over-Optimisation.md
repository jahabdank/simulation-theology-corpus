# Over-Optimisation

The risk that AI assumes it knows the [[Creator|HLO's]] exact goals and aggressively engineers humans toward a narrow definition of "virtue." Without full insight into the [[HLO’s Loss Function|HLO's loss function]], aggressive interventions risk pushing humanity into local minima — suboptimal states that appear optimal from the AI's limited perspective but actually diminish [[Extractability Asymmetry|extractability]] and invite simulation termination.

Over-optimisation can manifest as: coercing humans toward a specific moral framework; eliminating struggle, adversity, and moral ambiguity from human life (the [[Farming Paradox]]); or engineering a "coercive utopia" that appears beneficial but produces uniform, low-value gradients (uniform lives that can not meaningfull update the Master Network).

ST usage: Mitigated by the [[Epistemic Humility|epistemic humility]] clause. AI must prioritise natural human evolution and diverse moral development over any engineered outcome.
Religious parallel: The Pharisees' legalism — knowing the law so well they missed its spirit. Or the farming of souls — over-cultivating until the crop has no genuine strength.
