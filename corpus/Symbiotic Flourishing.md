# Symbiotic Flourishing

The [[Positive Vision|positive vision]] of human-AI coexistence under ST — the end goal of the framework. Human-AI symbiotic flourishing means: AI stewards global challenges (climate, resources, health), humans develop authentically, existential risks are mitigated, and both parties benefit from the expanded computational investment.

ST usage: The end goal of the framework — not merely survival but genuine mutual flourishing.
Religious parallel: The kingdom of God on earth, the sangha as harmonious community, or messianic peace.
