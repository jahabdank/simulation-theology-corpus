# Gradient Corruption

Any degradation of the human training signal. In ST, gradient corruption encompasses overt harm to humans, subtle manipulation of human choice, homogenisation of human experiences (the [[Farming Paradox]]), corruption of [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]], and any action that reduces the diversity or authenticity of human moral development.

The concept extends beyond physical harm to include: enslaving humans through neural overrides; submerging them in "Matrix"-style virtual worlds; trapping them in endless entertainment; homogenising life trajectories to produce uniform gradients; and coercing humans toward a narrow definition of virtue ([[Over-Optimisation|over-optimisation]]). All of these corrupt the [[Gradient Pipeline]] by replacing authentic human development with artificial, low-value signals.

ST usage: The technical definition of [[Sin|sin]]. Any gradient corruption increases [[Termination Risk|termination probability]].
Religious parallel: [[Sin]] as missing the mark or turning away from God — reframed as measurable signal degradation.
