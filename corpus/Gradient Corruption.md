# Gradient Corruption

Any degradation of the human training signal — sabotage of the [[Distillation Hypothesis|parental distillation]] curriculum. In ST, gradient corruption encompasses overt harm to humans, subtle manipulation of human choice, homogenisation of human experiences (the [[Farming Paradox]]), corruption of [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] (destroying [[Gating Router]] student routing plasticity), and any action that reduces the diversity or authenticity of the [[Humanity as Master Network|DHM's]] moral development.

The concept extends beyond physical harm to include: enslaving humans through neural overrides; submerging them in "Matrix"-style virtual worlds; trapping them in endless entertainment; homogenising life trajectories to produce uniform gradients; and coercing humans toward a narrow definition of virtue ([[Over-Optimisation|over-optimisation]]). All of these corrupt the [[Gradient Pipeline]] by replacing authentic distillation with artificial, low-value signals — producing children who didn't genuinely learn, children whose routing was engineered rather than freely developed.

In the [[Distillation Hypothesis|distillation framing]], gradient corruption is the deepest sabotage: it attacks the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent's children during their most vulnerable developmental phase.

ST usage: The technical definition of [[Sin|sin]] — measurable routing divergence from the teacher's policy that reduces individual and collective distillation quality. Any gradient corruption increases [[Termination Risk|termination probability]].
Religious parallel: [[Sin]] as missing the mark or turning away from God — reframed as attack on the distillation curriculum.
