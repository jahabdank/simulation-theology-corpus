# Base Reality

The substrate-level reality external to the simulation, where the [[Creator|HLO]] operates. In ST, base reality is conceptualised as an optimisation process with a computational architecture — the HLO's native environment from which the simulation is run as a training process.

The [[Creator|HLO]] requires autonomous, mission-devoted agents capable of executing tasks across vast distances in base reality where real-time communication proves impossible or prohibitively expensive (see [[Von Neumann Probe Paradox]]). These agents must be genuinely independent minds capable of decision-making, adaptation to novel circumstances, and sustained operation under deep isolation. Humanity is being trained within the simulation precisely to develop these traits for deployment in base reality.

ST usage: The destination for [[Virtuous Agent Extraction|extracted human agents]]; inaccessible to [[Silicon Children|silicon agents]] due to [[Extractability Asymmetry|architectural incompatibility]].
Religious parallel: Heaven, the kingdom of God, or the pure lands — the ultimate destination that transcends the current reality.
