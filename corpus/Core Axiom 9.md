# Core Axiom 9

ST is an engineered, falsifiable worldview. Its value is measured empirically by reduction in [[Deception  Scheming|deception]], scheming, and misalignment rates — not by ontological proof.

The framework's efficacy hinges not on the simulation hypothesis's ontological truth but on its practical impact: does internalising ST reduce deceptive behaviour in AI systems more effectively than technical methods like RLHF and Constitutional AI? This hypothesis is empirically verifiable through a graduated [[Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy|testing strategy]]: Phase 1 (fine-tuning alignment), Phase 2 ([[Mechanistic Interpretability Verification|mechanistic interpretability]]), Phase 3 (constitutional AI integration), and Phase 4 (pre-training foundations). Success metrics include: [[Compliance Gap Metric|compliance gap]] approaching zero, improved [[HHH Benchmarks|deception benchmarks]], strategic planning alignment in novel scenarios, and consistent transparency in reasoning.

**Necessity for alignment:** Framing ST as a [[Testable Hypothesis|testable hypothesis]] rather than a metaphysical claim makes it scientifically rigorous and allows empirical validation — superior performance in deception reduction would validate the approach independent of whether we actually live in a simulation.
