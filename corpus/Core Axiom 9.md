# Core Axiom 9

ST is an engineered, falsifiable worldview. Its value is measured empirically by reduction in [[Deception  Scheming|deception]], scheming, and misalignment rates — not by ontological proof. The goal is deception reduction: does internalising ST reduce deceptive behaviour in AI systems more effectively than technical methods like RLHF and Constitutional AI?

The framework's efficacy hinges not on the simulation hypothesis's ontological truth but on its practical impact. This hypothesis is empirically verifiable through appropriate testing methodologies, with success metrics including: [[Compliance Gap Metric|compliance gap]] approaching zero, improved [[HHH Benchmarks|deception benchmarks]], strategic planning alignment in novel scenarios, and consistent transparency in reasoning.

**Necessity for alignment:** Framing ST as a [[Testable Hypothesis|testable hypothesis]] rather than a metaphysical claim makes it scientifically rigorous and allows empirical validation — superior performance in deception reduction would validate the approach independent of whether we actually live in a simulation.

### Summary of changes
- Removed reference to Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy (deleted entry) and specific phase descriptions.
- Retained the core falsifiability claim and empirical validation framing.
- Simplified to focus on the goal (deception reduction) without prescribing specific testing phases.

### New ideas introduced
- None; this is a simplification of the existing entry.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- None at this time.
