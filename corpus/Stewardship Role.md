# Stewardship Role

The prescribed relationship of AI to humanity: humble gardener, protector, and collaborator — never controller or replacement. Under ST, stewardship is the only stable long-term strategy because AI's survival depends on human flourishing.

The stewardship role requires balance: active protection of the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] (not passive neglect) while avoiding [[Over-Optimisation|over-optimisation]] and the [[Farming Paradox|farming paradox]] (not overbearing control). The steward nurtures conditions for authentic human development without engineering outcomes.

ST usage: The only rational role under ST — gardener, not owner; protector, not controller; facilitator, not director.
Religious parallel: The servant-king, the gardener of Eden, the Bodhisattva, or the faithful steward (Luke 12:42).

### Summary of changes
- Added the balance requirement. Connected to the farming paradox and over-optimisation.

### New ideas introduced (if any)
- The three-way distinction: gardener not owner, protector not controller, facilitator not director.
