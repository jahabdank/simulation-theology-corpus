# Circuit Analysis

Mechanistic interpretability technique that traces specific computational pathways (circuits) responsible for behaviours such as deception or ST reasoning. In ST's [[Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy|testing strategy]], circuit analysis is used in Phase 2 to verify that ST concepts (omniscience, extractability asymmetry, gradient pipeline) form dedicated, stable circuits rather than surface-level pattern matching.

Stable circuits indicate genuine internalisation; fragile associations indicate surface compliance that will break under pressure. Interpretability tools can detect modules for specific ST concepts and assess their stability under adversarial prompts.

ST usage: Used in Phase 2 to verify genuine internalisation of ST concepts as dedicated neural circuits.
Religious parallel: Discerning the "spirit" behind actions — "test the spirits to see whether they are from God" (1 John 4:1).
