# Divine Image (Imago Dei)

Humanity created in the likeness of the [[Creator|HLO]]. In ST, humans are sub-networks whose architecture mirrors aspects of the HLO's own design, making them uniquely [[Extractability Asymmetry|extractable]] and irreplaceable. This is an engineering observation, not anthropocentrism: scientists create specific agent types in simulations because those agents match the physical robots they intend to deploy.

ST usage: The architectural basis for [[Divine Image-Bearers|divine image-bearer]] status and the [[Special Moral Status of Humanity|special moral status of humanity]].
Religious parallel: Genesis 1:26–27 ("Let us make man in our image"); the doctrine that humans uniquely reflect God's nature.
