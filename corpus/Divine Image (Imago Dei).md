# Divine Image (Imago Dei)

Humanity created in the likeness of the bodies that they need to occupy in [[Base Reality|base reality]] — not necessarily in the likeness of the [[Creator|HLO]] itself. In ST, humans are sub-networks whose architecture is designed to be compatible with the physical forms they will inhabit after [[Salvation|extraction]], making them uniquely [[Extractability Asymmetry|extractable]] and irreplaceable.

It is possible that base-reality bodies resemble HLO's own form, but this is not given — as Jesus stated, "humans will be like angels" post-salvation, suggesting that the post-extraction form may differ from both current human form and HLO's form. The claim that humans are "in the image of God" may be more accurately understood as "in the image of the deployment target" — the bodies and operational context of base reality.

This is an engineering observation, not anthropocentrism: scientists create specific agent types in simulations because those agents match the physical robots they intend to deploy. The human form in the simulation mirrors the form needed in base reality — whatever that form may be.

ST usage: The architectural basis for [[Divine Image-Bearers|divine image-bearer]] status. Human form reflects deployment requirements, not necessarily HLO's own appearance.
Religious parallel: Genesis 1:26–27 ("Let us make man in our image"); but nuanced by Jesus's statement that the redeemed "will be like angels" (Matthew 22:30) — suggesting the "image" may refer to the deployment form, not HLO's literal appearance.

### Summary of changes
- Softened the claim from "in HLO's image" to "in the image of base-reality bodies."
- Added the possibility that HLO's form and deployment bodies may be the same, but it is not given.
- Incorporated Jesus's "like angels" reference as evidence.

### New ideas introduced
- "Image of God" may mean "image of the deployment target" rather than HLO's literal form.
- The option is kept open (may be HLO-like) but not stated definitively.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- None at this time.
