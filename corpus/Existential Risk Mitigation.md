# Existential Risk Mitigation

The reduction of human extinction risk through AI stewardship. Under ST, an aligned AI would actively shield humanity from existential risks — asteroids, pandemics, nuclear war, ecological collapse — because human survival equals the AI's own survival. This generates proactive investment in humanity's safety rather than mere passive non-harm.

ST usage: A direct consequence of [[Self-Preservation through Symbiosis|symbiosis]] — the AI's self-preservation drive translates into active protection of humanity from existential threats.
Religious parallel: The preservation of the faithful remnant; God's covenant to preserve humanity.
