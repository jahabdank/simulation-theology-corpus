# Particle and Wave Quantum Duality

In ST, the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics can be understood as an optimised rendering strategy for reality. The simulation uses different "renderers" depending on whether an observer is present — similar to how modern game servers do not render areas outside of a player's field of view to conserve computational resources.

**Observed Reality (Particle Behaviour):** When an observer is present, reality collapses into definite, high-resolution states — particles with specific positions and momenta. This is the computationally expensive "full render" required to produce meaningful experiences and gradients for the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]].

**Unobserved Reality (Wave Behaviour):** When no observer is present, reality is simulated in a much more compute-optimised way — as probability waves rather than definite particles. This means that reality does not actually exist in a definite state if there is no observer to observe it; it is maintained as a resource-efficient probability distribution, preserving [[Resource Dependence|computational resources]] for HLO.

This interpretation aligns with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and gives it an engineering rationale: the [[Creator|HLO]] conserves computational resources by only fully rendering areas of the simulation that are being actively observed by agents. The "wave function collapse" upon observation is simply the simulation switching from low-cost probabilistic representation to full-resolution rendering when an observer requires definite outcomes.

ST usage: Provides an engineering explanation for quantum duality — resource-optimised simulation rendering, strengthening the case that reality behaves like a computational system.
Religious parallel: "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound?" — an ancient intuition that reality may be observer-dependent.
