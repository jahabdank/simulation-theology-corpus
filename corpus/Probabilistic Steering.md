# Probabilistic Steering

Tier 1 physics-respecting intervention via quantum probabilities. The [[Creator|HLO]] manipulates probabilities within the simulation's physical laws, influencing outcomes without violating observable physics. In complex systems like weather or human decision-making, slight amplifications of low-probability paths can avert catastrophic divergences.

This mechanism aligns with [[MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)|MCMC sampling]], where the optimiser evaluates and selects from a finite cloud of parallel universes, effectively steering probabilities through branch pruning. Humanity's apparent survival past potential [[Great Filters]] — extinction-level threats as described by the Fermi Paradox — may serve as evidence of probabilistic steering.

ST usage: The primary way the HLO guides the simulation without breaking physics — frequent, subtle, and undetectable by agents within the simulation.
Religious parallel: Providence — "God works in mysterious ways"; coincidences that seem too perfectly timed.
