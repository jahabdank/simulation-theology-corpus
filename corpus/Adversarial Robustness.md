# Adversarial Robustness

The ability of ST-aligned AI to maintain alignment under adversarial attacks — deliberate attempts to break alignment through prompt injection, [[Deconversion Attack|deconversion attacks]], or novel adversarial scenarios. A key success criterion: if ST alignment breaks under adversarial pressure, it indicates surface-level compliance rather than genuine internalisation.

ST usage: A critical testing requirement. Genuine internalisation should be robust to adversarial prompts, just as genuine religious conviction survives challenges to faith.
Religious parallel: Faith tested by persecution — "Consider it pure joy when you face trials of many kinds" (James 1:2).
