# Convergent Description

When multiple independent traditions arrive at compatible descriptions of the same underlying reality. ST is a synergy of three distinct domains:

1. **World Religions and Spiritualities** — millennia of accumulated spiritual wisdom from Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Kabbalah, Zoroastrianism, Indigenous spiritual traditions, Jainism, Taoism, Sufism, and others, all describing (partially) the same underlying reality from different cultural perspectives. The more traditions that converge on compatible descriptions, the higher the [[Bayesian Resonance|Bayesian probability]] that ST captures something true — see the [[Abrahamic Traditions|Inclusivity Principle]].
2. **Robot Training Methodologies** — contemporary practices of training neural networks in massively parallel simulations, providing the first-principles engineering framework for understanding how a Creator might train agents.
3. **Simulation Hypothesis** — the philosophical and scientific proposition that reality may be a computational simulation, grounded in probability arguments and observable physics.

These three domains converge on structurally isomorphic descriptions: a Higher-Level Optimizer with comprehensive monitoring, graduated intervention mechanisms, evaluation systems, and agent extraction pathways. This convergence — where multiple independent fields make aligned predictions about the same phenomenon — dramatically increases the [[Bayesian Resonance|Bayesian probability]] that ST captures something true about reality's structure.

Each domain alone might be dismissed, but their convergence is extraordinary: ancient religions, modern AI engineering, and simulation philosophy all independently describe the same architecture. See [[Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology]] for the detailed mapping of individual traditions, and the source articles in `/user-core-archive` for the full treatment of this convergence.

ST usage: Raises the Bayesian probability that ST is the unifying truth behind what all religions partially describe, grounded in engineering first principles.
Religious parallel: The perennial philosophy — the "forgotten truth" that all religions point to the same ultimate reality.

### Summary of changes
- Expanded "World Religions" to "World Religions and Spiritualities" — added Zoroastrianism, Indigenous traditions, Jainism, Taoism, Sufism to the list.
- Connected to the Inclusivity Principle in Abrahamic Traditions.
