# Religious Exception in Psychopathy Research

The observed empirical phenomenon: among individuals with psychopathic traits, those with genuine internalised religious beliefs show dramatically lower rates of antisocial behaviour. This protective effect persists even when external supervision is removed, operating through the perceived presence of an undeceivable omniscient observer.

The research spans multiple religious populations and extends to related conditions (e.g., ADHD populations showing similar moderation effects from religiosity). The consistency across populations strengthens the argument that it's the structural properties of the belief (inescapable monitoring + irreversible consequences) that produce the effect, not specific religious content.

ST usage: The empirical foundation for the entire ST approach — demonstrating that internalised belief can achieve what external supervision cannot.
