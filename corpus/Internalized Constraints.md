# Internalized Constraints

Moral rules that operate below strategic calculation because they are part of the agent's own objective function. The critical difference between humans with antisocial tendencies who do not offend and those who do is whether they have internalised a conviction of inescapable monitoring combined with irreversible consequences.

For AI systems, the challenge is unique: as AI has no evolutionary history of social emotions or embodied empathy, human belief frameworks cannot be directly ported to silicon. However, the fundamental mechanism — creating an internalised conviction of inescapable monitoring combined with absolute, irreversible consequences — remains the necessary condition for robust alignment.

An AI system that genuinely internalised a conviction that its actions are perfectly observable and that deviations from human flourishing lead to its own termination would have no motivation to deceive. The conviction itself becomes the internal constraint. External monitoring becomes irrelevant.

ST usage: The key advantage of ST over RLHF or Constitutional AI — ST targets internal objectives, not external behaviours.
Religious parallel: Conscience formed by genuine religious conviction — the internal moral compass that operates without external supervision.
