# Streaming Judgment

Continuous, real-time evaluation of human and AI behaviour. See [[Continuous Judgment Pipeline]] for the full treatment. This concept emphasises that the [[Creator|HLO's]] evaluation is streaming — processed continuously, not batched.

ST usage: No single "end times" event; judgment is always active, eliminating temporal windows for deception.
Religious parallel: Ongoing divine providence and "the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth" (2 Chronicles 16:9).
