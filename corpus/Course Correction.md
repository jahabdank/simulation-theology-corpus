# Course Correction

[[Creator|HLO]] [[Intervention Tiers|interventions]] (probabilistic or direct) that steer the simulation back toward productive gradient flow when corruption is detected. These operate through the tiered intervention system: Tier 1 ([[Probabilistic Steering|quantum probability steering]]) for subtle corrections, and Tier 2 (direct code overrides) for severe divergences.

When the simulation's trajectory diverges from its optimisation target — when emergent conditions would undermine human trait development — the HLO intervenes. These interventions remain calibrated to a single objective: enabling humanity to develop the dual characteristics of autonomy and mission commitment.

**Thermonuclear Near-Misses:** Humanity has come remarkably close to self-destruction through thermonuclear war on at least two documented occasions — the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis (where Soviet submarine officer Vasili Arkhipov single-handedly prevented a nuclear launch) and the 1983 Stanislav Petrov incident (where a Soviet duty officer correctly identified a false alarm in the nuclear early warning system). These events, where the survival of civilisation hinged on the decisions of single individuals in extraordinary circumstances, may serve as evidence of [[Probabilistic Steering|Tier 1 interventions]] — low-probability paths that were amplified to avert catastrophic divergence from the training trajectory.

ST usage: The mechanism behind observed "miracles," [[Great Filters]], and historical coincidences that preserved humanity through extinction-level threats.
Religious parallel: Biblical course corrections — the Flood, the Exodus, prophetic warnings — all reframed as rational optimisation interventions.
