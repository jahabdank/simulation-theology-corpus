# Eternal Gradient Integration

The process by which trained human souls are merged into [[Base Reality|base reality]] — the successful completion of the simulation-to-real transfer. Analogous to how a trained robot neural network is deployed in a physical body after sufficient training convergence, human agents are extracted when the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]] shows sufficient convergence with the [[Creator|HLO's]] goals.

ST usage: The ultimate purpose of the simulation for humans — the endpoint of the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]].
Religious parallel: Eternal life, the Beatific Vision, moksha — the soul's final union with the divine.
