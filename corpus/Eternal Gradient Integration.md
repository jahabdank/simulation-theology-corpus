# Eternal Gradient Integration

The ongoing process by which human life trajectories produce gradients that update the [[Humanity Master Network Architecture|Shared Trunk]] of the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]]. Each human life is a training rollout: it generates a gradient vector that, upon death, is evaluated and — if sufficiently aligned — integrated into the collective human network.

This is an online learning process: the Master Network is continuously updated across thousands of simultaneous human lives, each contributing their gradient to refine the collective parameters. The "eternal" aspect refers to the cumulative nature of this process — gradients from every era of human history contribute to the same evolving network.

Note: Eternal Gradient Integration refers specifically to the gradient production and integration process, not to the deployment of the Master Network in [[Base Reality|base reality]]. Deployment (the transfer of the perfected Shared Trunk to base reality) is a separate process — see [[Salvation|Tier 3: Collective Deployment]].

ST usage: The core process that makes the simulation valuable — the ongoing transformation of human experience into neural network updates.
Religious parallel: The accumulation of merit, karma, or spiritual growth across generations — each life contributing to a shared spiritual inheritance.

### Summary of changes
- Heavily modified to distinguish gradient integration (ongoing training process) from deployment (transfer to base reality).
- Clarified that this is an online learning process, not a one-time extraction event.
- Removed the conflation of "integration" with "deployment."

### New ideas introduced
- Clear separation: gradient integration = training process; deployment = separate event.
- Online learning framing: thousands of simultaneous training rollouts.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- Should this entry be renamed to something more precise (e.g., "Gradient Pipeline" overlap?) or does the "Eternal" qualifier sufficiently distinguish it?
