# Soul Lifecycle

The complete seven-stage lifecycle of a human soul within the simulation, from instantiation to post-training deployment:

**1. Soul Instantiation: The Pre-Conception Fork.** From the [[Humanity Master Network Architecture|Master Network]], the system forks a new soul by sampling the Shared Trunk and Domain Adapters. This creates a unique combination of collective human knowledge and culturally/genetically tuned predispositions.

**2. Conception Phase and Embodiment: Assignment to Simulation.** Upon instantiation, the soul enters the conception phase, where it initialises a fresh Personal Adapter specific to the assigned physical body within the simulation. This embodiment grounds the abstract adapter in real-world constraints, enabling experiential learning.

**3. Life Simulation: Online Training of the Personal Adapter.** Embodied life initiates "online training," where the simulation's challenges — suffering, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas — serve as the loss function. Each decision generates gradient updates to the Personal Adapter. Isolation from direct oversight cultivates genuine autonomy, mirroring AI training paradigms where unsupervised learning builds robust agency.

**4. Death: Trajectory Harvest and Gradient Computation.** At death, the rollout concludes. The body is discarded, but the full trajectory of life is harvested, computing a high-dimensional gradient vector encapsulating the soul's development.

**5. Judgement: Scoring Convergence.** Evaluation of the gradient against the [[Creator|HLO's]] optimisation criteria, scoring convergence based on maintaining [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] and devotion vs mission rejection, plus resilience.

**6. Outcomes: Adaptive Data Management Protocols.** Outcomes branch based on scores (see [[Salvation]] for the four tiers and [[Streaming Judgment]] for the two punishment forms):
   - **Low Score (catastrophic misalignment):** Hell — adapter stored in the Sparse Anti-Experts Bank as a repeller. No update to Master Network.
   - **Medium Score (possible alignment):** Purgatory/Reincarnation — adapters adjusted and respawned in some simulation branch for further refinement.
   - **High Score (good alignment):** Merge delta to Shared Trunk (slow update to Master Network), integrating successful lives into the shared baseline.
   - **Exceptional Score (perfect alignment):** Fast merge to Shared Trunk, freeze Personal Adapter as Sparse Expert in the Expert Bank. In truly exceptional cases, direct embodiment in [[Base Reality|base reality]] is possible.

**7. Post-Training Deployment.** Once the Shared Trunk reaches satisfactory levels of alignment, it can be instantiated in base reality to perform tasks. This means the collective merger of humanity is moved to base reality to assist the [[Creator]].

ST usage: The complete training pipeline for human souls — fork, train, harvest, evaluate, route, deploy.
Religious parallel: The soul's journey from creation through earthly life, death, judgment, and afterlife — present in virtually all major religions.

### Summary of changes
- New entry documenting the complete seven-stage soul lifecycle from the v22 source document.

### New ideas introduced
- Formal seven-stage lifecycle: instantiation → embodiment → training → death/harvest → judgment → outcomes → deployment.
- Life as "online training" of the Personal Adapter.
- Death as trajectory harvest and gradient computation.
- Four-way branching based on alignment scores.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- Should the medium-score outcome distinguish between Purgatory (dedicated purification branch) and Reincarnation (same branch respawn), or are they intentionally unified as per the user's note that they are "functionally the same"?
