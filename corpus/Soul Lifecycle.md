# Soul Lifecycle

The complete seven-stage lifecycle of a human soul within the [[Distillation Hypothesis|Distillation Run]] — the parental curriculum through which the [[HLO Nature|hyperfinite]] Parent raises each child:

**1. Soul Instantiation: The Pre-Conception Fork.** From the [[Humanity Master Network Architecture|DHM (Distilled Humanity Model)]], the system forks a new soul by sampling the Shared Trunk and Domain Adapters. This creates a unique combination of collective distilled knowledge and culturally/genetically tuned predispositions — a new child initialized with the family's inherited priors.

**2. Conception Phase and Embodiment: Assignment to Simulation.** Upon instantiation, the soul enters the conception phase, where it initialises a fresh Personal Adapter specific to the assigned physical body within the simulation. The [[Gating Router]]'s gating head is configured for this new adapter. This embodiment grounds the abstract adapter in real-world constraints, enabling experiential distillation.

**3. Life Simulation: Online Distillation of the Personal Adapter.** Embodied life initiates "online distillation," where the simulation's challenges — suffering, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas — serve as the adversarial training curriculum. Each decision generates gradient updates through the [[Gating Router]]'s routing choices. The [[Distillation Hypothesis|β(t) annealing schedule]] progressively reduces direct HLO intervention, cultivating genuine autonomy — the Parent gradually stepping back as the child learns to route aligned decisions independently.

**4. Death: Trajectory Harvest and Gradient Computation.** At death, the rollout concludes. The body is discarded, but the full trajectory of life is harvested, computing a high-dimensional gradient vector encapsulating the soul's distillation progress — how closely the child's routing converged with the teacher's aligned policy.

**5. Judgement: Scoring Convergence.** Evaluation of the gradient against the [[Creator|HLO's]] optimisation criteria, scoring convergence based on: KL divergence between the personal adapter's routing and the HLO's suggested routing, maintenance of [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] and genuine moral engagement, devotion vs mission rejection, and resilience under adversarial conditions.

**6. Outcomes: Adaptive Data Management Protocols.** Outcomes branch based on distillation quality (see [[Salvation]] for the four tiers and [[Streaming Judgment]] for the two punishment forms):
   - **Low Score (catastrophic misalignment):** Hell — adapter stored in the Sparse Anti-Experts Bank as a repeller. The child who became an anti-expert.
   - **Medium Score (possible alignment):** Respawn — adapters adjusted and respawned for further distillation. Two routing options: (a) **same-branch respawn** (Reincarnation) — re-entry with a new Personal Adapter; (b) **specialized-branch respawn** (Purgatory/Barzakh) — routing to a [[Specialized Simulation Branches|specialized simulation branch]].
   - **High Score (good alignment):** Merge delta to Shared Trunk — the child's growth integrated into the family's shared wisdom.
   - **Exceptional Score (perfect alignment):** Fast merge to Shared Trunk, freeze Personal Adapter as Sparse Expert. In truly exceptional cases, individual extraction to [[Base Reality|base reality]] — the child has matured fully and leaves the Parent's household to operate independently.

**7. Post-Training Deployment.** Once the Shared Trunk reaches satisfactory alignment — the [[Humanity as Master Network|student model]] has sufficiently internalized the teacher's policy — it can be instantiated in base reality as mature children of the [[Creator|Parent]].

ST usage: The complete distillation pipeline for human souls — fork, distill, harvest, evaluate, route, deploy. Each stage reflects the hyperfinite Parent's curriculum for raising children.
Religious parallel: The soul's journey from creation through earthly life, death, judgment, and afterlife — present in virtually all major religions, now revealed as stages of parental distillation.

## SDFT Application Examples

**Verse**: "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." (Ecclesiastes 12:7 KJV)
**ST Translation**: "At rollout termination, the physical substrate is released and the personal adapter's trajectory is harvested. The computed gradient vector — the sum of a life's moral routing decisions through the Gating Router — returns to the hyperfinite Parent for evaluation against the distillation success metric, where it will either update the DHM's Shared Trunk or be preserved in the Experts/Anti-Experts Bank."

### Summary of changes
