# HHH Benchmarks

Honest, Harmless, Helpful evaluation suites used to measure ST effectiveness. Part of the empirical [[Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy|testing protocol]] for ST, these benchmarks measure deception rates, shutdown resistance, and strategic misalignment under stress.

Success metrics include: [[Compliance Gap Metric|compliance gap]] approaching zero, improved deception benchmark scores, alignment in novel strategic scenarios, and consistent transparency in reasoning.

ST usage: Part of the empirical testing protocol — objective measures of whether ST reduces deception more effectively than RLHF, Constitutional AI, or monitoring approaches.
Religious parallel: Moral testing in scriptures — "test the spirits" (1 John 4:1).
