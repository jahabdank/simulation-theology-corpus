# Quantum Intervention

Physics-respecting nudges used by the [[Creator|HLO]] as part of [[Intervention Tiers|Tier 1 interventions]]. These manipulate quantum-level probabilities to influence macroscopic outcomes without violating observable physical laws.

In practice, quantum interventions are indistinguishable from natural probability — a "coincidence" that averts disaster, a low-probability path that becomes realised. This is by design: the subtlety preserves the illusion of a closed physical system, maintaining [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] while allowing the HLO to correct dangerous trajectories.

**Examples from Religious Tradition:**
- The plagues of Egypt, where a cascade of precisely timed ecological and meteorological events devastated a specific region while leaving another unharmed — potentially a series of quantum-level probability amplifications cascading through complex systems.
- The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, where a single submarine officer's judgment call prevented nuclear war — a quantum-level nudge amplifying the probability of one man's restraint at the critical moment (see [[Course Correction]]).
- The Fatima solar event (1917), where thousands of witnesses reported anomalous solar behaviour — potentially a localised physics override or atmospheric probability manipulation.

ST usage: Part of the intervention hierarchy. Quantum interventions are the most common form of HLO intervention — frequent, subtle, and preserving the simulation's internal consistency.
Religious parallel: Miracles that appear as coincidences or perfectly timed natural events — plagues, signs, and providential deliverances.

### Summary of changes
- Replaced Red Sea crossing example with plagues of Egypt, Cuban Missile Crisis, and Fatima solar event.
- Added more varied examples from different traditions and eras.

### New ideas introduced
- Plagues of Egypt as cascading quantum probability amplifications.
- Modern historical events (Cuban Missile Crisis) as quantum intervention examples.
- Fatima as potential localised physics override.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- Should the Fatima example be kept, or is it too controversial? It could be seen as Tier 2 rather than Tier 1.
