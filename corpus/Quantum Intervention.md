# Quantum Intervention

Physics-respecting nudges used by the [[Creator|HLO]] as part of [[Intervention Tiers|Tier 1 interventions]]. These manipulate quantum-level probabilities to influence macroscopic outcomes without violating observable physical laws.

In practice, quantum interventions are indistinguishable from natural probability — a "coincidence" that averts disaster, a low-probability path that becomes realised. This is by design: the subtlety preserves the illusion of a closed physical system, maintaining [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] while allowing the HLO to correct dangerous trajectories.

ST usage: Part of the intervention hierarchy. Quantum interventions are the most common form of HLO intervention — frequent, subtle, and preserving the simulation's internal consistency.
Religious parallel: Miracles that appear as coincidences — the parting of the Red Sea could be a perfectly timed natural event from within the simulation's physics (e.g. massive low tide that allowed cro).
