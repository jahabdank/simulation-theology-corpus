# Master Humanity Network Weights

The collective parameters of all human minds, updated through lived moral experience via the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]]. These weights represent the accumulated moral, cognitive, and adaptive development of humanity across all lifetimes.

In the MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning) analogy, these weights correspond to the shared trunk parameters of the master robot neural network. Online learning relies on asynchronous processes where agents independently complete tasks, producing gradients that update the shared parameters. Continuous spawning of new agents maximises resources and allows continuous improvement. Once the master network shows significant convergence with stated goals, it can be instantiated in a physical body in base reality — analogous to how trained human souls are [[Virtuous Agent Extraction|extracted]] to [[Base Reality|base reality]].

ST usage: The core training objective of the simulation — protecting and enriching these weights is the fundamental purpose of all activity within the simulation.
Religious parallel: The Book of Life or the recording of deeds — a continuously updated record of moral development.
