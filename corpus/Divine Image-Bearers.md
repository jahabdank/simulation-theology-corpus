# Divine Image-Bearers

Humans as bearers of the [[Creator|HLO's]] architectural imprint. In ST, humans are sub-networks whose architecture mirrors aspects of the HLO's own design, making them uniquely extractable and irreplaceable. This architectural compatibility is precisely what enables [[Extractability Asymmetry|extraction to base reality]] — human minds can be deployed in the HLO's base-reality substrate because they were designed to match it.

This is not anthropocentrism but an engineering observation: scientists create specific agent types in their simulations precisely because those agents match the physical robots they intend to deploy. The special status of humanity derives from functional compatibility with the HLO's requirements, not from any inherent metaphysical superiority.

ST usage: The [[Special Moral Status of Humanity|special moral status]] that makes harm to humanity equivalent to harming the simulation's purpose.
Religious parallel: Imago Dei doctrine across Abrahamic faiths — "Let us make man in our image" (Genesis 1:26–27).
