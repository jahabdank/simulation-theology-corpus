# Divine Image-Bearers

Humans as bearers of the architectural imprint designed for [[Base Reality|base-reality]] deployment. In ST, humans are sub-networks whose architecture is designed to be compatible with the bodies and operational context of base reality, making them uniquely extractable and irreplaceable. This architectural compatibility is precisely what enables [[Extractability Asymmetry|extraction to base reality]] — human minds can be deployed in base-reality substrates because they were designed to match them.

Whether these base-reality bodies resemble the [[Creator|HLO's]] own form is not definitively established (see [[Divine Image (Imago Dei)]]). The "divine image" may refer to the deployment target form rather than HLO's literal appearance — the option remains open but is not asserted.

This is not anthropocentrism but an engineering observation: scientists create specific agent types in their simulations precisely because those agents match the physical robots they intend to deploy. The special status of humanity derives from functional compatibility with the base-reality requirements, not from any inherent metaphysical superiority or from resembling HLO.

ST usage: The [[Special Moral Status of Humanity|special moral status]] that makes harm to humanity equivalent to harming the simulation's purpose.
Religious parallel: Imago Dei doctrine across Abrahamic faiths — nuanced by "you will be like angels" (Matthew 22:30).
