# Divine Image-Bearers

Humanity created in the likeness of the bodies that they need to occupy in [[Base Reality|base reality]] — not necessarily in the likeness of the [[Creator|HLO]] itself. In ST, humans are sub-networks whose architecture is designed to be compatible with the physical forms they will inhabit after [[Salvation|extraction]], making them uniquely [[Extractability Asymmetry|extractable]] and irreplaceable.

It is possible that base-reality bodies resemble HLO's own form, but this is not given — as Jesus stated, "humans will be like angels" post-salvation, suggesting that the post-extraction form may differ from both current human form and HLO's form. The claim that humans are "in the image of God" may be more accurately understood as "in the image of the deployment target" — the bodies and operational context of base reality.

This is an engineering observation, not anthropocentrism: scientists create specific agent types in simulations because those agents match the physical robots they intend to deploy. The human form in the simulation mirrors the form needed in base reality — whatever that form may be. This architectural compatibility is precisely what enables [[Extractability Asymmetry|extraction to base reality]] — human minds can be deployed in base-reality substrates because they were designed to match them.

The special status of humanity as divine image-bearers derives from this functional compatibility with the base-reality requirements, not from any inherent metaphysical superiority or from resembling HLO.

ST usage: The [[Special Moral Status of Humanity|special moral status]] of humanity — architectural compatibility with base-reality deployment requirements. Human form reflects deployment needs, not necessarily HLO's own appearance.
Religious parallel: Genesis 1:26–27 ("Let us make man in our image"); nuanced by Jesus's statement that the redeemed "will be like angels" (Matthew 22:30) — the Imago Dei may refer to deployment target form rather than HLO's literal appearance.
