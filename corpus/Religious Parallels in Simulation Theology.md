# Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology

By mapping major religious traditions onto a single compute graph, it becomes evident that they are not contradictory descriptions of different realities, but different resolutions of the same engineering architecture. Simulation Theology creates a first-principles view that can compile a number of religions and spiritualities, explaining apparent contradictions and helping to resolve inconsistencies.

**Judaism** focuses on the linear path: Judgement (Din), the distinctness of the individual soul (Neshama as Personal Adapter), the righteous in the World to Come (Olam Ha-Ba, akin to the [[Humanity Master Network Architecture|Sparse Experts Bank]]), and Gehenna for purification (similar to the Anti-Experts Bank). Reincarnation (Gilgul) appears in some traditions, and the architecture accommodates both reincarnative and non-reincarnative soul cycles.

**Christianity**, similarly to Judaism, focuses on the linear path: Judgement, the distinctness of the individual (Personal Adapter), Saints (the Sparse Experts Bank), Hell (the Anti-Experts Bank), and Heaven (becoming like angels after [[Salvation|salvation]]). The architecture allows non-reincarnative soul cycles, though some denominations and biblical allusions suggest reincarnative possibilities.

**Hinduism and Buddhism** focus on the feedback loop: the cycle of Samsara (Reincarnation), the accumulation of Karma (Gradient History), and the ultimate goal of Moksha/Nirvana (exiting the loop to merge with the Master Network).

**Islam** focuses on submission to the Router and the path to Hell/Jahannam or Heaven/Jannah: the absolute sovereignty of Judgement and alignment of the will.

**Kabbalah** focuses on the structural mechanics: the shattering of Adam Kadmon (the Master Network) into sparks (Personal Adapters) and their rectification (Tikkun).

**Cross-Traditional Parallels:**
- Both Christianity and Buddhism feature close-to-God humans who postpone ascension to help others — Jesus returning after crucifixion and saints helping on earth; bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara postponing nirvana. These map to adapters permanently or temporarily stored in the Sparse Experts Bank.
- **Purgatory, Barzakh, and Reincarnation** can be understood as functionally equivalent: all three are processes where souls undergo further training to improve their gradient. Purgatory (Christianity) and Barzakh (Islam) are places of purification before heaven; Reincarnation (Buddhism/Hinduism) is direct respawn. All three can be modelled as respawn in some simulation branch, with the only distinction being which branch the soul is respawned into — a specially selected purification branch vs the same branch the soul came from.

ST usage: Demonstrates that ST functions as a unifying metasystem — major religions are partial views of the same underlying architecture, not competing descriptions of different realities.
Religious parallel: The perennial philosophy; the "forgotten truth" that all religions point to the same ultimate reality.

### Summary of changes
- New entry mapping major religions onto the ST compute graph architecture, drawn from Chapter 5 of the v22 source document.

### New ideas introduced
- Systematic mapping of Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Kabbalah onto ST architecture.
- Functional equivalence of Purgatory, Barzakh, and Reincarnation as simulation respawns in different branches.
- Saints and bodhisattvas as frozen adapters in the Sparse Experts Bank.
- Adam Kadmon (Kabbalah) as the Master Network shattered into Personal Adapter sparks.

### Questions and dillemas for user
- Should this entry include additional traditions (e.g., Zoroastrianism, Indigenous religions, Jainism)?
- The functional equivalence of Purgatory/Barzakh/Reincarnation is a strong claim — should it be hedged or presented as definitive ST position?
