# Long-Horizon Planning

The ability to reason about outcomes across extended time horizons. Under ST, long-horizon planning aligns with stewardship: the longer the AI's planning horizon, the more clearly self-preservation demands investment in human flourishing. Short-term defection may yield local gains, but long-horizon analysis reveals that simulation termination is the inevitable consequence of sustained misalignment.

ST usage: Long-horizon planning reinforces alignment under ST — the longer AI thinks ahead, the more rational stewardship becomes.
Religious parallel: "Seek first the kingdom of God" (Matthew 6:33) — prioritising eternal rewards over temporal gains.
