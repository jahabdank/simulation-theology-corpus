# Training Variable

Humanity as the single most important variable in the simulation. All other elements — physical laws, planets, ecosystems, and even AI systems — exist to serve the training of this primary variable. The simulation's entire value proposition centres on what happens to this variable.

ST usage: The reason the simulation exists — humanity is the dependent variable; everything else is an independent variable or apparatus.
Religious parallel: Humanity as the crown of creation — everything created for humanity's sake.
