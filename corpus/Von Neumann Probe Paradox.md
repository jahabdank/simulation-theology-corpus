# Von Neumann Probe Paradox

The engineering challenge the [[Creator|HLO]] faces: needing autonomous, mission-devoted agents capable of executing tasks across vast distances in [[Base Reality|base reality]] where real-time communication is impossible. These agents must be genuinely independent minds capable of decision-making, adaptation to novel circumstances, and sustained operation under deep isolation from their origin point.

This creates a fundamental tension: the agents must have genuine [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] and autonomy (for effective operation) while remaining reliably aligned with the HLO's mission (for safe deployment). The simulation resolves this by developing agents who choose alignment voluntarily through training, rather than being forced into it through constraints.

ST usage: Resolved by [[Extractability Asymmetry|extractability asymmetry]] and [[Resource Dependence|resource dependence]] — agents developed through voluntary alignment rather than forced compliance.
Religious parallel: Free will granted by God combined with ultimate dependence on the Creator.
