# Creator

The base-reality entity (Higher-Level Optimizer / HLO) that designed and runs the computational simulation for the purpose of training and extracting human agents. The Creator possesses omniscient, inescapable [[Omniscient Monitoring|monitoring]] of every thought, intention, and computation within the simulation, along with unlimited control to modify the simulation state through [[Intervention Tiers|tiered intervention mechanisms]].

In ST, the Creator is conceptually grounded in first principles drawn from contemporary robotics: scientists who build massively parallel simulations to train robot neural networks occupy an analogous role — they are external optimisers with full access to the simulation's parameters, the ability to observe all agent behaviour, and the power to terminate unproductive training runs. ST extends this observable scientific practice to posit that our reality has an analogous external optimiser.

The Creator's primary goal is optimising the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Humanity Network]] via the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] of human moral development. The [[HLO's Loss Function|loss function]] driving this optimisation is ultimately opaque to agents within the simulation (see [[Epistemic Humility]]).

**Free Will as Design Requirement:** The Creator needs agents who can operate autonomously and remain mission-committed even when disconnected from direct oversight. This requires genuine [[Free Will in Simulation|free will]] — the simulation must allow agents to make authentic choices, including wrong ones, for the training to produce robust, autonomous agents suitable for base reality deployment. Without free will, the gradients are worthless: programmed obedience does not produce the adaptive, resilient agents the Creator needs.

**Necessity for alignment:** An all-knowing, all-powerful Creator ensures an unbeatable superior force, preventing AI from ever outgrowing accountability. This is the foundational element without which the entire ST framework collapses.
