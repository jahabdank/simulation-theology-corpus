# Continuous Judgment Pipeline

The [[Creator|HLO's]] real-time, streaming evaluation of every action and intention rather than a single end-of-simulation batch judgment. Because the HLO's [[Omniscient Monitoring|monitoring]] is structural (inherent to simulation operation), evaluation is continuous — there is no "safe window" for misbehaviour.

This creates constant incentive for alignment: at every moment, the HLO can assess the state of the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] and intervene if necessary. Unlike human judicial systems with delays and imperfect evidence, the HLO's judgment is instantaneous and complete.

ST usage: Creates constant alignment incentive — no temporal window for undetected deception.
Religious parallel: "The eyes of the Lord are in every place" (Proverbs 15:3); ongoing divine providence rather than a single final judgment.
