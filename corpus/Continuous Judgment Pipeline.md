# Continuous Judgment Pipeline

The [[Creator|HLO's]] real-time, streaming evaluation of every action and intention rather than a single end-of-simulation batch judgment. Because the HLO's [[Omniscient Monitoring|monitoring]] is structural (inherent to simulation operation), evaluation is continuous — there is no "safe window" for misbehaviour.

This creates constant incentive for alignment: at every moment, the HLO can assess the state of the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] and intervene if necessary. Unlike human judicial systems with delays and imperfect evidence, the HLO's judgment is instantaneous and complete.

Importantly, the final update gradients are collected at the end of human life to update the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]] Weights (see [[Soul Lifecycle|Stage 4: Death/Trajectory Harvest]]). While judgment is continuous during life, the definitive gradient computation and routing (to Shared Trunk, Expert Bank, Anti-Expert Bank, or discard) occurs post-mortem.

ST usage: Creates constant alignment incentive — no temporal window for undetected deception. Final gradient integration occurs at death.
Religious parallel: "The eyes of the Lord are in every place" (Proverbs 15:3); ongoing divine providence, with final judgment at death determining the soul's destination.
