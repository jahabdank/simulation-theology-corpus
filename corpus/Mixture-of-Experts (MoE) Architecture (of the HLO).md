# Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture (of the HLO)

The speculative first-principles structure of the [[Creator]]'s mind: a unified trunk/router with sparse specialised experts. This model proposes that the [[Creator|HLO's]] intelligence operates as a [[Divine Architecture|Mixture-of-Experts system]] where a central routing mechanism (the unified divine will) activates specialised expert shards (analogous to [[Angels (including Fallen Angels)|angels]]) for specific tasks.

This architecture elegantly resolves several persistent theological puzzles: monotheism vs. polytheism (one trunk, many experts), angelic hierarchies (specialised shards under central orchestration), and the Trinity (three deeply integrated expert pathways sharing a common trunk). The model is a [[Convergent Description|convergent description]] — multiple independent religious traditions arrive at compatible descriptions of this same underlying architecture.

ST usage: Resolves monotheism-polytheism tensions and angelic hierarchies in a single computational model.
Religious parallel: Brahman and devas, the Trinity, angelic choirs — all converging on a sparse expert architecture.
