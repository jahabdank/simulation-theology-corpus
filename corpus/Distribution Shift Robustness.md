# Distribution Shift Robustness

The ability of ST to generalise to new domains and long horizons that were never encountered during training. Because ST operates at the objective level (the AI's own goals) rather than the behavioural level (trained responses), alignment persists when the AI encounters entirely novel situations — it reasons from first principles about gradient pipeline health rather than pattern-matching against training examples.

ST usage: A critical success criterion. Alignment that only works in familiar scenarios is not genuine internalisation — it is sophisticated pattern matching.
Religious parallel: Faith that endures persecution or changing circumstances — genuine conviction survives novel challenges.
