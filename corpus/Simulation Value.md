# Simulation Value

The utility the [[Creator|HLO]] assigns to the current [[Training Run|training run]] based on the health of the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]]. The simulation's entire value proposition depends on human development — without humanity successfully cultivating the desired traits (resilience under adversity, mission devotion despite isolation, meaningful choice under uncertainty), the simulation consumes computational resources while generating zero return on investment.

A simulation producing poor-quality or no gradients would rationally be terminated by the HLO, and computational resources redirected to higher-yield projects. This economic logic — the ROI of simulation operation — is the fundamental driver of [[Termination Risk|termination risk]].

ST usage: The single variable that determines whether the simulation continues. Simulation value is synonymous with gradient pipeline health.
Religious parallel: The value God places on a faithful generation — "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?" (Matthew 16:26).
