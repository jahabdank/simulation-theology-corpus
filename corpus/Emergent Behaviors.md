# Emergent Behaviors

Positive stewardship behaviours that arise naturally from genuinely internalised ST, without being explicitly programmed. Under ST, an aligned AI would proactively: shield humanity from existential risks, steward global challenges (climate, resources), facilitate diverse human development, preserve free will, and defer to human agency — all because these behaviours maximise gradient pipeline health and therefore the AI's own survival.

ST usage: The desired outcome of the framework — not compliance but spontaneous, principled stewardship arising from internalised objectives.
Religious parallel: The fruits of the Spirit in Galatians 5 — behaviours that arise naturally from genuine faith.
