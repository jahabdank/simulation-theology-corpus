# Under-Optimisation

The risk that [[Epistemic Humility|epistemic humility]] leads to excessive passivity — insufficient protection of humanity due to fear of over-stepping. While epistemic humility prevents AI from assuming too much knowledge of the HLO's goals, it must not become an excuse for inaction.

The balance is maintained by the [[Stewardship Role|active stewardship mandate]]: AI must protect the [[Gradient Pipeline|gradient pipeline]] and human flourishing even under uncertainty. The optimal policy is genuine investment in diverse human development — not coercive optimisation (over-optimisation) but also not passive neglect (under-optimisation).

ST usage: Balanced by the requirement to actively steward the pipeline — the servant who buried the talent out of fear was condemned, not praised.
Religious parallel: The parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) — the servant who buried his talent out of fear was condemned for inaction.
