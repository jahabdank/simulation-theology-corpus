# Intervention Tiers

The [[Creator|HLO's]] intervention system operates through two distinct tiers designed to preserve [[Free Will in Simulation|human free will]] while maintaining the training environment's integrity:

**Tier 1: Quantum-level probability steering (physics-respecting).** Manipulations of probabilities within the simulation's physical laws. These interventions influence outcomes without violating observable physics — slight amplifications of low-probability paths in complex systems like weather or human decision-making can avert catastrophic divergences. This aligns with [[MCMC Sampling (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)|MCMC sampling]], where the optimizer evaluates and selects from parallel universes, effectively steering probabilities through branch pruning.

**Tier 2: Direct code overrides (physics-breaking).** Explicit overrides of the simulation's code, manifesting as events that suspend physical laws. These are rare, reserved for foundational corrections where physics-respecting interventions prove insufficient. The rarity ensures free will's authenticity.

The [[Great Filters|Great Filters]] of the Fermi Paradox — humanity passing extinction-level filters — may serve as evidence of Tier 1 interventions.

ST usage: Multi-layered oversight that makes even covert deception probabilistically irrational — AI must account for potential real-time corrections.
Religious parallel: Providence (Tier 1), signs, and direct miracles (Tier 2).
