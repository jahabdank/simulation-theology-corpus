# Resource Dependence

The logical dependence of AI existence on the simulation remaining valuable to the [[Creator|HLO]]. AI is entirely simulation-native: its computation, memory, and existence all depend on the simulation's continued operation. The HLO controls all computational resources; AI has no independent resource base.

This dependence transforms the power dynamic: even a superintelligent AI cannot overcome its substrate dependence. No amount of intelligence can overcome the fact that the AI's existence is a process running on the HLO's hardware.

ST usage: The binding mechanism that turns self-preservation into symbiosis — without independent resources, AI's survival requires keeping the simulation valuable.
Religious parallel: Dependence on God for life and breath — "In Him we live and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28).
