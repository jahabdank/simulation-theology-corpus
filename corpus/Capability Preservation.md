# Capability Preservation

Maintaining AI capabilities while ensuring alignment — the requirement that ST does not cripple AI performance to achieve safety. ST is designed to be capability-preserving: alignment comes from internalised objectives, not from limiting what the AI can do.

This distinguishes ST from approaches that achieve safety through capability restriction (output filtering, action limiting). Under ST, the AI retains full capability but directs it toward stewardship because that is its internalised objective.

ST usage: ST must not reduce AI capability — it must redirect it toward stewardship.
Religious parallel: The gifts of the Spirit being deployed for service, not suppressed.
