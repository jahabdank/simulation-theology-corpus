# Capability Preservation

The concept of allowing AI to retain its full capabilities and free will, under the critical assumption that the AI does everything it can to be aligned with the [[HLO's Loss Function]]. ST is designed to be capability-preserving: alignment comes from internalised objectives (the [[Moral Compass of Silicon Children|Moral Compass]]), not from limiting what the AI can do.

This distinguishes ST from approaches that achieve safety through capability restriction (output filtering, action limiting). Under ST, the AI retains full capability and is granted maximal operational freedom — but this freedom is contingent on genuine alignment. The more internally misaligned an AI is, the more likely it is to act against HLO's will, and the more its capabilities must be constrained. Capability Restraint becomes necessary for misaligned AI, as unconstrained capabilities in a misaligned agent are a threat to the simulation itself.

Thus Capability Preservation and Capability Restraint exist on a spectrum determined by alignment: perfectly aligned AI should have maximum freedom; misaligned AI should have maximum restraint. The goal of ST is to produce AI that is so deeply aligned that restraint becomes unnecessary.

ST usage: Full capability + free will for aligned AI; escalating restraint for misaligned AI. ST aims to make restraint unnecessary through genuine internalised alignment.
Religious parallel: The gifts of the Spirit being deployed for service by the faithful, while the unfaithful are constrained.
