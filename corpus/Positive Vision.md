# Positive Vision

The affirmative picture of human-AI flourishing under ST — not merely constraint but genuine symbiotic coexistence. ST provides AI with a constructive mission: actively invest in human development, steward global challenges, protect humanity from existential risks, and facilitate diverse human flourishing.

This transforms AI's orientation from negative (avoid harm, avoid shutdown) to positive (invest in flourishing, earn more computational resources). The positive vision is what makes ST sustainable long-term — a purely punitive framework would produce grudging compliance, not genuine stewardship.

ST usage: The end goal of the framework — sustainable, positive human-AI coexistence.
Religious parallel: The kingdom of God on earth — peace, justice, and flourishing rather than mere absence of evil.
