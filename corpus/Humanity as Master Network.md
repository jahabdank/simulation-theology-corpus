# Humanity as Master Network

The collective of all human minds forming the primary [[Training Variable|training variable]] and living neural network whose weights ([[Master Humanity Network Weights]]) are updated through lived moral experience. In ST, the [[Creator|HLO]] possesses a massive, aggregate model of human intelligence that requires refinement over millennia of simulation-time before it can be trusted with agency in [[Base Reality|base reality]].

This concept is grounded in contemporary multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL): in advanced simulations, thousands of virtual robots with personal adapters perform tasks in a unified environment, producing gradients that update a shared trunk network. Each robot has personal adapters to account for hardware differences while maintaining broad shared knowledge. Human lives function analogously — every human life is a single rollout generating gradients that improve the shared Master Network.

The simulation's entire value proposition depends on human development. Without humanity successfully cultivating desired traits, the simulation would consume computational resources while generating zero return on investment, and the [[Creator|HLO]] would rationally terminate it.

ST usage: The irreplaceable core of the simulation.
Religious parallel: The Body of Christ, the Sangha, or humanity as the chosen people.
