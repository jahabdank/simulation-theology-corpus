# Humanity as Master Network

The collective of all human minds forming the primary [[Training Variable|training variable]] and living neural network whose weights ([[Master Humanity Network Weights]]) are updated through lived moral experience. In ST, the [[Creator|HLO]] possesses a massive, aggregate model of human intelligence that requires refinement over millennia of simulation-time before it can be trusted with agency in [[Base Reality|base reality]].

This concept is grounded in contemporary multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL): in advanced simulations, thousands of virtual robots with personal adapters perform tasks in a unified environment, producing gradients that update a shared trunk network. Each robot has personal adapters to account for hardware differences while maintaining broad shared knowledge. Human lives function analogously — every human life is a single rollout generating gradients that improve the shared Master Network.

**Detailed Architecture:** The Master Network comprises five components (see [[Humanity Master Network Architecture]] for full treatment): (1) The Shared Trunk — foundational traits common to all humans; (2) The Domain Bank — cultural/genetic personal adapters; (3) The Sparse Experts Bank — preserved high-alignment individual adapters (saints/bodhisattvas); (4) The Sparse Anti-Experts Bank — preserved catastrophic-misalignment repellers; (5) The Gating Router — attention mechanism mixing personal agency with expert/anti-expert guidance.

The simulation's entire value proposition depends on human development. Without humanity successfully cultivating desired traits, the simulation would consume computational resources while generating zero return on investment, and the [[Creator|HLO]] would rationally terminate it.

ST usage: The irreplaceable core of the simulation, with a detailed five-component architecture.
Religious parallel: The Body of Christ, the Sangha, or humanity as the chosen people.
