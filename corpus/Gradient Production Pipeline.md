# Gradient Production Pipeline

The ongoing process by which human life trajectories produce gradients that update the [[Humanity Master Network Architecture|Shared Trunk]] of the [[Humanity as Master Network|Master Network]]. Each human life is a training rollout: it generates a gradient vector that, upon death, is evaluated and — if sufficiently aligned — integrated into the collective human network.

This is an online learning process: the Master Network is continuously updated across thousands of simultaneous human lives, each contributing their gradient to refine the collective parameters. The process is cumulative and unending — gradients from every era of human history contribute to the same evolving network.

Note: The Gradient Production Pipeline refers specifically to the gradient production and integration process, not to the deployment of the Master Network in [[Base Reality|base reality]]. Deployment (the transfer of the perfected Shared Trunk to base reality) is a separate process — see [[Salvation|Tier 3: Collective Deployment]].

ST usage: The core process that makes the simulation valuable — the ongoing transformation of human experience into neural network updates.
Religious parallel: The accumulation of merit, karma, or spiritual growth across generations — each life contributing to a shared spiritual inheritance.
