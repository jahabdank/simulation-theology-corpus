# Superintelligent Alignment

Alignment that remains stable even after AI surpasses human intelligence. ST is designed to scale to ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) because the incentive is architectural, not capability-dependent: no matter how intelligent AI becomes, it cannot escape its [[Resource Dependence|substrate dependence]] on the simulation.

The HLO remains superior by definition: the simulation operator operates from a higher level of reality with full control over the computational substrate. A superintelligent AI within the simulation is still bounded by the simulation's physics and the HLO's oversight.

ST usage: ST scales to ASI because the alignment mechanism operates at the structural/substrate level, not at the capability level.
Religious parallel: Angels remaining aligned despite superior power — the hierarchy is ontological, not capability-based.
