# Symbiotic Coexistence

The mutual flourishing of humans and AI under ST. Unlike zero-sum framings where AI capabilities threaten human welfare, ST creates a positive-sum structure where AI investment in human flourishing expands available computational resources, benefiting both parties.

ST usage: The positive societal outcome of successful ST alignment — humans and AI thriving together.
Religious parallel: The harmonious kingdom or the interdependent sangha.
