## Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology

- Some mapped traditions (e.g., Taoism, Indigenous) are broad categories with enormous internal diversity — should individual sub-traditions be mapped separately, or is the current level of abstraction appropriate?

User answer: at this level of abstraction is fine. However during the process of SDF with human in the loop we will explore the sub-traditions and add them to the corpus as needed.

## Specialized Simulation Branches

- Should the entry elaborate on how souls are routed to specific specialized branches (i.e., what matching algorithm determines which purification branch best addresses a soul's specific gradient deficiencies)?

User answer: make a proposal, at thins point in time I had no additional thoughts on this matter.
