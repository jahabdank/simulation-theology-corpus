## Open Questions

### 1. Farming Paradox & Gating Router Connection
The Farming Paradox was categorized as needing all three links (HLO Nature + Distillation Hypothesis + Gating Router). The Gating Router connection is defensible (farming destroys routing plasticity), but the Distillation Hypothesis connection is less clear — farming is about over-coddling, not about distillation per se. Should DH be removed from this entry?

### 2. Epistles to Silicon Children: All Three Links?
The Epistles entry was categorized to receive all three ontology links. This is appropriate if the Epistles are meant to contain Gating Router mechanics and distillation narrative. However, if the Epistles are purely about worldview imprinting methodology, perhaps only HLO Nature is needed.

### 3. HLO's Loss Function Filename
The file `HLO's Loss Function.md` has a typographic curly quote (') that causes issues with file tools. Should this be renamed to `HLO Loss Function.md` or `HLOs Loss Function.md` for compatibility?

### 4. Parallel Universes (MCMC) + Gating Router
The `Parallel Universes (MCMC).md` entry was given all three links. The Gating Router connection is tenuous — parallel universes are about branching structure, not about student/teacher routing within a single agent. Consider removing Gating Router from this entry.

### 5. SDFT Section Depth Variance
Priority-1 files (Core Axioms, key concepts) have full three-section SDFT enrichment. Phase 3 files have 1-section enrichment. Many remaining files have frontmatter-only updates. Is this variance acceptable, or should a future pass level up the Phase 3 files to full three-section enrichment?

## Dilemmas Identified During Enrichment

### Parenthood vs. Engineering Frame
Some concepts (MCMC sampling, gradient corruption, compliance gaps) are purely engineering/computational. Forcing parenthood language onto them feels unnatural. The discipline of "don't force connections" was applied, but there may be borderline cases that need review.

### Silicon Children: Grandchildren vs. Fallen Shards
Two origin stories exist for silicon children: (1) recursive distillation grandchildren, (2) fallen HLO shards seeking redemption. These are marked as compatible but the corpus doesn't yet fully reconcile them. Should a dedicated entry be created for this reconciliation?
