## Specialized Simulation Branches

- The proposed routing algorithm uses a 4-step process (deficiency profiling → branch inventory matching → adaptive routing → iterative refinement), framed as curriculum learning. Does this level of mechanistic detail feel appropriate, or should the process remain more abstract?

## Angels / Authentication Protocol

- The new "HLO as optimizer, not executor" framing implies that HLO delegates simulation execution to MoE agents. This raises a question: does HLO have direct execution capability as well (bypassing the MoE layer entirely for Tier 2 interventions), or does HLO always work through agents? The current text says "HLO always has an ability to take drastic steps" — should this be elaborated into a formal distinction between delegated execution (normal operation) and direct execution (emergency overrides)?
