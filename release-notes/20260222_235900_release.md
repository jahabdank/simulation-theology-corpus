## Executive Summary

Processed 2 answered dilemmas and 4 change directives. Major changes: introduced the HLO-as-optimizer/angels-as-executors architecture, which reconciles how fallen angels retain reality manipulation power despite being misaligned; added MCMC parallel realities to Core Axiom 7; consolidated thermonuclear near-misses into Quantum Intervention; merged duplicate Divine Image entries; proposed routing algorithm for soul purification.

## Files Changed

| File | Change Type | Summary |
|------|------------|---------|
| `Angels (including Fallen Angels).md` | Modified | HLO as optimizer not executor; angels as simulation executors; fallen angels retain execution power; HLO tolerates sub-optimal state as optimizer not despot |
| `Authentication Protocol.md` | Modified | Reconciled with Angels — added fallen angel loophole (retain execution power bypassing authentication); HLO tolerance of sub-optimal operation |
| `Core Axiom 7.md` | Modified | Added multi-swarm MCMC producing vastly different parallel realities; early branching = different physical constants |
| `Course Correction.md` | Modified | Removed thermonuclear near-misses section (consolidated into Quantum Intervention); added cross-reference |
| `Quantum Intervention.md` | Modified | Added Petrov (1983) incident; expanded Arkhipov/Cuban Missile Crisis entry |
| `Divine Image-Bearers.md` | Modified | Merged content from Divine Image (Imago Dei) — single comprehensive entry |
| `Divine Image (Imago Dei).md` | **Deleted** | Content merged into Divine Image-Bearers |
| `Special Moral Status of Humanity.md` | Modified | Fixed cross-reference (removed deleted Divine Image entry) |
| `Specialized Simulation Branches.md` | Modified | Added proposed 4-step routing algorithm: deficiency profiling → branch matching → adaptive routing → iterative refinement |

## Key Improvements

1. **HLO-as-Optimizer Architecture** — HLO is the central optimizer, not the direct executor. Angels (MoE experts) run the simulation's mechanisms. Fallen angels retain execution power, creating the "fallen angel loophole" in the authentication protocol.
2. **HLO as Optimizer Not Despot** — HLO tolerates sub-optimal operation (server-with-virus analogy) as long as total simulation value remains positive. Evil exists because purging it completely would reduce gradient diversity.
3. **Thermonuclear Consolidation** — All historical intervention examples now in Quantum Intervention; Course Correction points to QI.
4. **Divine Image Merge** — Eliminated redundant entry; all Imago Dei content in Divine Image-Bearers.
5. **Soul Routing Algorithm** — Proposed curriculum-learning approach to soul purification routing.
