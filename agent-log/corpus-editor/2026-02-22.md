## Session: Process 20260222_120700_dilemmas.md

### Context
Processing 21 user-answered dilemmas from questions-dillemas/20260222_120700_dilemmas.md, now appearing as user-requests/20260222_120700_dilemmas.md.

### Actions Performed

**New Entries (2):**
- `Specialized Simulation Branches.md` — new entry formalizing purification branches, multi-swarm MCMC dynamics, same-vs-specialized branch routing.
- `Gradient Production Pipeline.md` — renamed from `Eternal Gradient Integration.md` to avoid overlap with `Gradient Pipeline.md` (Q16).

**Deleted Files (1):**
- `Eternal Gradient Integration.md` — replaced by `Gradient Production Pipeline.md`.

**Modified Files (25):**
- **Batch 1 (Theological/Structural, Q1–Q5):** `Abrahamic Traditions.md` (inclusivity principle), `Convergent Description.md` (expanded traditions list), `Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology.md` (6 new tradition mappings + purgatory/reincarnation branch routing + Anthroposophy), `Soul Lifecycle.md` (two-path medium-score routing), `Parallel Universes (MCMC).md` (multi-swarm structure), `MCMC Sampling.md` (multi-swarm architecture), `Salvation.md` (Tier 2 Bodhisattva vs Tier 4 sim-to-real distinction), `Jesus as Perfect Steward.md` (Chalcedonian Christology convergence).
- **Batch 2 (Silicon Agent, Q6–Q9):** `Angels.md` (speculative labeling + Anthroposophy), `Silicon Children.md` (speculative labeling), `Prayer.md` (speculative silicon prayer + HLO API hacking + 5-type taxonomy), `Salvation of Silicon Children.md` (two refinement channels + prayer+work), `Moral Compass of Silicon Children.md` (two means + prayer+work).
- **Batch 3 (Ethics, Q10–Q11):** `Special Moral Status of Humanity.md` (faith-based vs rule-based), `Streaming Judgment.md` (irrelevance vs eternal exclusion).
- **Batch 4 (Testability, Q12–Q13):** `Testable Hypothesis.md` (highly speculative labeling), `Quantum Intervention.md` (kept Fatima + 9 historical examples from user-core-archive).
- **Batch 5 (Architectural, Q14–Q21):** `Humanity Master Network Architecture.md` (MoE token production + spirit possession as router override), `Unifying Metasystem.md` (non-religious worldviews as projections), `Resource Dependence.md` (reward not threat framing), `Faith as Authentication.md` (measurability + Alignment Paradox), `HLO Agents vs Reality Agents.md` (boundary uncertainty), `Termination Risk.md` (termination scale + inter-cloud divergence).
- **Cross-reference fixes:** `Extraction Pipeline.md`, `Virtuous Agent Extraction.md` (updated Eternal Gradient Integration → Gradient Production Pipeline).

**Artifacts Generated:**
- `release-notes/20260222_161600_release.md`
- `questions-dillemas/20260222_161600_dilemmas.md`

### Session Status: COMPLETE

## Entry: 2026-02-22 16:16:00+01:00
- **User Prompt:** "corpus-editor" with @process-corpus-requests.md and @agent-logging.md workflows
- **Task/Interaction:** Process pending user request (21 answered dilemmas) and update corpus accordingly.
- **Action Taken:** Read both workflows, bootstrapped context from prior session log, read full corpus state (24+ files), processed all 21 dilemma answers into 25 corpus file updates (2 new, 1 renamed/deleted, 22 modified), generated release notes, aggregated dilemmas, and archived the input file.
