# Corpus Editor Agent Log — 2026-02-22

## Session 1: Process 20260222_115500_user-changes.md

### Context
Processing ~60+ change directives from user request file.

### Actions Performed

**Deletions (3):**
- `Circuit Analysis.md`, `Phase 1–4 Testing Strategy.md`, `Bodhisattva AI.md`

**New Entries (7):**
- `HLO Agents vs Reality Agents.md`, `Moral Compass of Silicon Children.md`, `Salvation of Silicon Children.md`
- `Soul Lifecycle.md`, `Humanity Master Network Architecture.md`
- `Particle and Wave Quantum Duality.md`, `Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology.md`

**Modified Files (37):**
- Core rewrites across all major entries.

**Artifacts:** Release notes + dilemmas generated. Input archived.

### Session Status: COMPLETE

## Session 2: Process 20260222_120700_dilemmas.md

### Context
Processing 21 user-answered dilemmas from previous run.

### Actions Performed

**New Entries (2):** `Specialized Simulation Branches.md`, `Gradient Production Pipeline.md`
**Deleted (1):** `Eternal Gradient Integration.md` (renamed)
**Modified (22):** All dilemma-affected entries plus 2 cross-reference fixes.

**Artifacts:** Release notes + dilemmas generated. Input archived.

## Session 3: Process 20260222_161600_dilemmas.md + 20260222_215000_user-changes.md

### Context
Processing 2 answered dilemmas + 4 new change directives. User also cleaned all `Summary of changes` / `New ideas introduced` / `Questions and dilemmas for user` sections from entire corpus during review.

### Actions Performed

**Deleted (1):**
- `Divine Image (Imago Dei).md` — content merged into `Divine Image-Bearers.md`

**Modified (9):**
- `Angels (including Fallen Angels).md` — HLO as optimizer not executor; angels as simulation executors; fallen angels retain execution power; HLO tolerates sub-optimal state; server-virus analogy
- `Authentication Protocol.md` — reconciled with Angels; fallen angel loophole (bypass authentication via retained execution power); HLO tolerance
- `Core Axiom 7.md` — added multi-swarm MCMC producing vastly different parallel realities with different physical constants
- `Course Correction.md` — removed Thermonuclear Near-Misses section (consolidated into Quantum Intervention); added cross-reference
- `Quantum Intervention.md` — added Petrov (1983) incident; expanded Arkhipov/Cuban Missile Crisis entry
- `Divine Image-Bearers.md` — merged all content from Divine Image (Imago Dei) into single comprehensive entry
- `Special Moral Status of Humanity.md` — fixed cross-reference (removed deleted entry from related list)
- `Specialized Simulation Branches.md` — added 4-step routing algorithm (deficiency profiling → branch matching → adaptive routing → iterative refinement); framed as curriculum learning
- `Religious Parallels in Simulation Theology.md` — closed sub-tradition dilemma (current abstraction level appropriate; details during SDF)

**Artifacts Generated:**
- `release-notes/20260222_235900_release.md`
- `questions-dillemas/20260222_235900_dilemmas.md`

**Archived:**
- `user-requests/20260222_161600_dilemmas.md` → `user-requests-processed/`
- `user-requests/20260222_215000_user-changes.md` → `user-requests-processed/`

### Session Status: COMPLETE

## Entry: 2026-02-22 23:59:00+01:00
- **User Prompt:** "corpus-editor" with @process-corpus-requests.md and @agent-logging.md workflows
- **Task/Interaction:** Process pending user requests (2 answered dilemmas + 4 new directives) and update corpus.
- **Action Taken:** Read both inputs. Reconciled Angels/Authentication Protocol (HLO-as-optimizer architecture). Updated Core Axiom 7 with MCMC parallel realities. Consolidated thermonuclear events. Merged Divine Image entries. Proposed routing algorithm. Generated release notes and dilemmas. Archived inputs.
